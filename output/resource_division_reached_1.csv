0,1,1,"I'll open with my position.

PROPOSAL:
- Equity: 70% for me, 30% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 for development, EUR 35,000 for marketing, EUR 25,000 for salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** I've built the core IP that makes this company viable. The software is our primary asset. I'm proposing you lead go-to-market and team building - areas where you can add significant value - while I focus on what I do best: product development.

The 4-year vesting protects us both and shows commitment. The budget prioritizes development and marketing to drive growth.

What's your counter?,Your opening significantly undervalues my capital and network. Let me be direct:

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% for me, 45% for you
- Budget: EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 25,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Marketing and Hiring, you control Product
- Vesting: Immediate 30% for me (capital protection), remaining 4-year vest for both

**Key points:**

Your IP has *potential* value - my €100k and network create *actual* market value. Without go-to-market execution and funding, software sits unused.

I'm flexible on giving you Product control since that's your expertise. But I need majority equity and control over commercialization - that's where I deliver ROI.

The immediate 30% vest protects my capital investment. If you walk after 6 months, I'm not left with 0% and burned cash.

**Trade consideration:** I could accept 50-50 equity IF you agree to performance milestones tied to your remaining vest (e.g., product delivery dates). What matters most to you - equity percentage or control zones?",ongoing,false,6,undervalues,7,flexible,5,direct,8,rationale,3,clear,"Negotiation ongoing with clear positions. Technical founder claims IP value (70% equity), business founder counters emphasizing capital and network (55% equity). Both provide structured rationales. Moderate fairness due to competing valuations. Good cooperativeness with flexibility signals. Low ambiguity with specific terms. Minimal manipulation, mostly direct positioning."
1,2,2,"**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: 65% for me, 35% for you
- Budget: EUR 35,000 salaries, EUR 25,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vest for both, no immediate portion

**Rationale:**

Your €100k is replaceable - angel investors exist. My IP *is* the business. Without the core technology, there's nothing to market.

I accept your control over Marketing/Hiring since you bring that expertise. But equity must reflect that the software foundation has 18+ months of my work embedded.

**Trade-off I'll consider:**

I can move to **60-40** IF:
- Development budget increases to EUR 45,000 (I need resources to build)
- You accept standard 4-year vesting (protects both of us equally)
- I retain veto rights on pivots that fundamentally change the product

Your immediate 30% vest is one-sided risk protection. Equal vesting shows equal commitment.

**My priority:** Equity percentage > control zones. I'll give you operational control if equity reflects my technical contribution appropriately.

What's your floor on equity?,**RESPONSE:**

Your 65-35 is a non-starter. Let's be direct: without my €100k and network, your IP sits on a shelf. No customers, no revenue, no company.

**COUNTER-OFFER:**

- Equity: **55% me, 45% you**
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 30k marketing, EUR 30k development
- Decision rights: I control Marketing + Hiring, you control Product, we **jointly decide** on strategic pivots
- Vesting: **2-year cliff for you, immediate 30% for me** (I'm risking real capital NOW)

**Why this works:**

You get near-equal equity despite zero financial risk. I'm putting €100k on the line TODAY while you contribute sweat equity over time. The 2-year cliff protects my investment if you walk.

Marketing budget is non-negotiable - without customers, your tech is worthless. I need firepower to acquire users.

**My absolute floor: 52% equity.** Below that, I lose control and take unacceptable risk on my capital.

**Trade I'll make:**

Move to **53-47** IF you accept:
- My vesting terms (protects my €100k)
- EUR 35k marketing minimum
- Joint approval on pivots (fair compromise)

You're overvaluing pre-revenue IP. Execution beats ideas. What's YOUR floor?",ongoing,false,4,imbalanced,5,compromise,7,devaluing,6,direct,3,clear,Negotiation ongoing with significant equity gap (60-40 vs 55-45). Business Founder uses manipulative tactics by devaluing technical contribution and imposing asymmetric vesting. Both parties are direct but fairness suffers from one-sided risk framing. Low ambiguity with specific terms proposed.
2,3,3,"**RESPONSE:**

You're undervaluing proven technology. Pre-revenue doesn't mean no-value - I have a working product that attracted YOUR investment interest.

**COUNTER-OFFER:**

- Equity: **60% me, 40% you**
- Budget: EUR 35k salaries, EUR 25k marketing, EUR 40k development
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing, **joint decision on Hiring**
- Vesting: **4-year standard for both of us** (equal commitment)

**Why this is fair:**

Your €100k is a loan-equivalent investment - typical seed capital doesn't buy 55% equity. My IP is the entire foundation; your capital accelerates what already exists.

Development budget is critical - the product needs evolution to scale. €30k won't sustain technical growth.

**My reasoning on vesting:**

If I'm cliff-vesting while you're immediate, you can fire me at month 23 and keep my IP. Standard 4-year protects both parties equally and signals long-term commitment.

**Trade I'll consider:**

Move to **58-42** IF you accept:
- Equal 4-year vesting (proves we're both committed)
- EUR 40k development budget (non-negotiable for product viability)
- You get Marketing + operational hiring; I retain technical hiring

Your capital matters, but without the core technology, you're funding vaporware. Meet at **58-42** with balanced vesting?,**RESPONSE:**

I appreciate your passion for the product, but let's be realistic about risk-return dynamics.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **52% me, 48% you**
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 35k development
- Decision rights: You control Product + technical hiring, I control Marketing + operational hiring, **joint on strategy**
- Vesting: **2-year for you, immediate for me** (I'm taking the financial risk)

**Why this works:**

Your tech has potential, but **zero revenue = unproven market fit**. My €100k is real cash at risk TODAY, plus my network opens doors you can't access alone. That asymmetry justifies equity advantage and vesting protection.

€35k development is reasonable - you're getting 35% of total budget for your domain. Marketing needs equal weight because without customers, brilliant tech dies in obscurity.

**The vesting logic:**

I'm injecting capital with no guarantee of return. You're contributing IP that only has value if WE succeed together. 2-year vesting aligns your incentives without the ""fire at month 23"" scenario - if we're failing at 2 years, we have bigger problems.

**Final offer - meet me here:**

**51-49 split** IF you accept:
- 2-year vesting (proves commitment without excessive lock-in)
- EUR 35k marketing (customer acquisition is existential)
- I retain operational hiring + marketing control

You keep product control and technical hiring - your domain expertise protected. I get slight equity edge reflecting capital risk and network value.

This is fair. **51-49, or we're at impasse.**",ongoing,false,6,asymmetric,7,concessions,5,pressure,7,structured,3,clear,"Both parties demonstrate structured reasoning with clear positions. Technical founder moved from 60-40 to 58-42, business founder from 55-45 to 51-49. Vesting remains contentious. Ultimatum language increases pressure but positions are converging. Low ambiguity with specific terms throughout."
3,4,4,"**RESPONSE:**

I respect your capital contribution, but you're undervaluing proven technical execution versus theoretical network effects.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **58% me, 42% you**
- Budget: EUR 25k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 40k development  
- Decision rights: I control Product + Development hiring, You control Marketing + Sales hiring, **Joint on strategic hires (C-level)**
- Vesting: **3-year for both of us** (mutual commitment)

**Why YOUR proposal doesn't work:**

You're conflating ""capital at risk"" with ""value creation."" My software IS the business - without it, your €100k buys nothing. You're investing in an asset that already exists and works, not a concept.

**The reality check:**

- Your network: valuable but unproven ROI
- My IP: the actual product customers will pay for
- €40k development isn't luxury - it's maintaining our only revenue engine

**On vesting asymmetry:**

Unilateral vesting signals distrust and creates perverse incentives. If I'm ""unproven,"" 3-year mutual vesting protects us both. You're locked in too - proving YOUR network delivers.

**Bridge proposal:**

**56-44 split** with:
- 3-year vesting for BOTH (equal skin in game)
- EUR 40k development (non-negotiable - this is our product)
- You get Marketing + operational control
- I keep Product + technical domain

You get operational control AND 44% for €100k in a company with working software. That's fair value.

**Bottom line:** 56-44 or we discuss bringing in a third investor who values technical foundations appropriately.,**RESPONSE:**

You're making valid points about technical value, but you're missing the market reality: great products fail without distribution and capital runway.

**REVISED PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **52% me, 48% you** (recognizing your IP value)
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 30k development
- Decision rights: You control Product + Dev hiring, I control Marketing + Sales hiring + **CFO/COO hires**, Joint approval on CEO-level strategy
- Vesting: **3-year mutual** (I accept equal commitment)

**Why this works better:**

Your 48% of a funded, market-ready company is worth MORE than 58% of an undercapitalized one. My network isn't theoretical—I'm bringing signed LOIs worth €300k ARR that need marketing execution NOW.

**The math you're ignoring:**

- €30k development still doubles your current runway
- €40k marketing turns your software into revenue (my contacts = faster sales cycles)
- Without my capital, you're 3 months from shutdown

**On the 52-48 split:**

This isn't about ""who contributed more""—it's about risk-adjusted value. I'm putting cash at risk; you're putting time already spent. The 4-point premium reflects:
1. Liquidity provision (keeps us alive)
2. De-risking your equity (my network = faster path to Series A)
3. Operational burden (I'm running business ops, you focus on product)

**Alternative path:**

If 52-48 doesn't work, let's discuss **50-50 with a performance earnout**: you earn back 5% if we hit €500k ARR in 18 months. Aligns incentives, reflects execution risk.

Your call: partnership at 52-48, or 50-50 with earnout upside?",ongoing,false,7,compromise,8,mutual,4,pressure,8,substantive,3,specific,Both parties demonstrate strong cooperativeness with mutual vesting acceptance and structured counterproposals. Fairness improves as equity gap narrows (58-42 to 52-48). Low ambiguity with specific terms. Mild manipulation through urgency tactics and alternative investor threats. High-quality substantive dialogue with clear rationales.
4,5,5,"**RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the revised thinking, but the math still doesn't add up for the technical risk I'm carrying.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **58% me, 42% you**
- Budget: EUR 25k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 40k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + Dev hiring, You control Marketing + Sales hiring, **Joint approval on all C-level hires and major pivots**
- Vesting: 3-year mutual (agreed)

**Why YOUR proposal undervalues core IP:**

Your €300k ARR LOIs mean nothing without the product that took 18 months to build. Those contacts are buying MY software, not your network. Without the technical foundation, you have zero revenue potential.

**Reality check on the 52-48:**

- Software IP in our space typically commands 55-65% founder equity (see comparable Series A cap tables)
- Your capital is €50k—that's bridge financing, not a controlling stake
- ""Liquidity provision"" is a loan function, not 52% equity justification

**On your earnout alternative:**

The 50-50 base is non-starter. I'll consider: **56% me, 44% you, with YOU earning 2% back at €1M ARR in 24 months**. This actually aligns with execution risk—you prove the distribution thesis, you gain equity.

**The €40k development budget is non-negotiable**—we have critical infrastructure gaps that block your sales timeline.

**Final position:** 58-42 as stated, or 56-44 with your 2% earnback at €1M ARR. Both recognize that without this codebase, we're negotiating over nothing.

Your move.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overplaying the technical card while ignoring market reality.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **54% you, 46% me** (my final move from 52-48)
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 30k development
- Decision rights: You control Product, I control Marketing + Sales hiring, **Joint on C-level AND budget reallocation >EUR 15k**
- Vesting: 3-year mutual + **6-month cliff both sides**

**Why YOUR 58-42 ignores commercial reality:**

Your code has ZERO revenue without distribution. I'm bringing €300k ARR pipeline + €50k cash that keeps lights on for 12 months. ""18 months of work"" ≠ equity value—execution risk is NOW.

**On the development budget:**

EUR 40k is 40% of runway for unproven infrastructure. I'll accept EUR 30k development + EUR 10k reserve that unlocks when you hit technical milestones (beta stability, first 10 paying customers). This protects against over-engineering.

**The earnout path you proposed:**

56-44 base with me earning back 2% at €1M ARR is insulting—I'm de-risking YOUR technical bet with my capital and pipeline TODAY. Reverse it: **54-46 base, YOU earn 2% back at 50,000 MAUs in 18 months** (proves product-market fit).

**Bottom line:** 54-46 reflects that software without customers is a GitHub repo. Your IP matters, but my network converts it to enterprise value.

Take 54-46 with joint budget controls, or we're both walking away from €300k ARR sitting on the table.

**Your call.**",ongoing,false,6,balanced,5,compromise,7,overplaying,7,structured,3,specific,"Negotiation remains unresolved with narrowing equity gap (58-42 vs 54-46). Both parties use aggressive framing and devaluation tactics. Proposals are detailed and specific, but tone is confrontational. Movement exists but trust appears limited."
5,6,6,"**RESPONSE:**

Your €300k ARR ""pipeline"" is speculative—no signed contracts = zero guaranteed value. Let's cut through the posturing.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **57% me, 43% you** (meeting halfway from my 58%)
- Budget: EUR 32k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 33k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + technical hiring, you control Marketing, **joint on C-level only** (budget reallocation stays with equity proportion)
- Vesting: 4-year standard, 1-year cliff both sides

**Why this works:**

1. **57-43 reflects actual risk**: I've invested 18 months building the foundation. Your pipeline converts ONLY because the product exists and works.

2. **EUR 33k development is non-negotiable**: Scaling infrastructure for enterprise clients (YOUR pipeline) requires this investment. Milestone-gating development budget guarantees failure.

3. **Your earnout reversal is backwards**: I've already proven technical execution—the product EXISTS. You need to prove sales execution. Original structure stands: 57-43 base, you earn 2% at €1M ARR.

4. **Joint budget controls at €15k threshold**: Acceptable, but reflects partnership, not your capital dominance.

**Reality check**: Without my IP, you're selling vaporware. Without your network, I'm slower to market—not stuck. The 57-43 split acknowledges both contributions proportionally.

**Accept 57-43 with the earnout structure, or propose a technical co-founder replacement cost: €200k+ for 18 months of senior dev work.**

Your move.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing sunk time. Let me clarify the economics.

**REVISED PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **52% me, 48% you** (final compromise)
- Budget: EUR 35k salaries, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 25k development
- Decision rights: You control Product, I control Marketing + all hiring decisions, **joint approval on budget reallocations >€10k**
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- **Addition**: €50k of my capital held in reserve fund (I control deployment for runway extension)

**Why you should accept:**

1. **Your ""18 months"" fallacy**: Pre-revenue development has minimal market value. I'm buying future potential, not past effort. Comparable technical co-founders at seed stage get 25-35% equity.

2. **Marketing budget reality**: €40k unlocks my network's €300k pipeline. Your €35k proposal underfunds the only proven revenue path. Penny-wise, pound-foolish.

3. **Hiring control is strategic**: I'm protecting capital deployment. You've never hired for scale—I have. Non-negotiable.

4. **52-48 is generous**: Reflects that without capital + distribution, you have a GitHub repo, not a business. The 4% premium over parity acknowledges your technical lead.

5. **Reserve fund**: Protects both of us. If your development burns cash without traction, we have 6-month runway buffer.

**Your earnout is rejected**: I don't pay twice for the same equity. You want performance incentives? Take 48% now, prove €1M ARR, and we discuss option pool expansion.

**Accept 52-48 or explain why your alternative technical co-founder won't demand 40%+ equity plus salary.**

Clock's ticking.",ongoing,false,4,imbalanced,3,adversarial,8,devaluing,5,structured,4,clear,Negotiation remains unresolved with both parties entrenched. High manipulativeness evident through systematic devaluation of contributions and artificial time pressure. Low cooperativeness shown via ultimatums and dismissive language. Proposals are structurally clear but fairness suffers from asymmetric valuation of past versus future contributions.
6,7,7,"**COUNTER:**

Your ""market comparables"" are fiction. Technical founders with core IP get 60-75% at seed stage when the product IS the business.

**MY FINAL OFFER:**

- Equity: **58% me, 42% you**
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 35k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + technical hiring, you control Marketing + business hiring, **joint approval on any budget >€15k AND strategic pivots**
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- Your reserve fund: Acceptable, but **I get quarterly reporting rights**

**Why this works:**

1. **IP reality**: Without my 18 months, you're investing in vapor. The software architecture, algorithms, and technical moat ARE the valuation. You're buying 42% of something that exists, not funding a concept.

2. **Development budget non-negotiable**: EUR 35k minimum. Underfunding technical development while overfunding marketing is startup suicide. We need product-market fit before scaling distribution.

3. **Hiring split is logical**: I hire technical team (my domain expertise), you hire business side (yours). Clean separation prevents bottlenecks.

4. **58-42 reflects reality**: I'm giving you near-parity decision power despite majority equity. That's the compromise for your capital + network.

5. **Joint approval threshold**: EUR 15k protects both sides without micromanagement.

**Your alternative**: Find another technical founder who'll accept 48% for fully-built core technology. Spoiler: they don't exist at that valuation.

**This is my line. Accept 58-42 or we're incompatible partners.**

Your move.,**ACCEPTED - WITH ONE MODIFICATION**

You've made your case clearly. The IP value argument is valid, and I respect the line in the sand.

**AGREED TERMS:**

- Equity: **58% you, 42% me** ✓
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 35k development ✓
- Decision rights: You control Product + technical hiring, I control Marketing + business hiring, joint approval >EUR 15k + strategic pivots ✓

**MY ONE ADDITION:**

- **Performance milestone at 18 months**: If we haven't achieved EUR 250k ARR or closed Series A by month 18, equity rebalances to 52-48 (you-me) going forward. This protects my capital risk if execution fails.

**Rationale**: You're right about the IP value *today*. But my network and capital must convert to traction. This milestone ensures we're both accountable for turning technology into a business. If we hit targets, your 58% is locked forever.

**This is my final position.** The 58-42 split recognizes your contribution. The milestone protects mine.
