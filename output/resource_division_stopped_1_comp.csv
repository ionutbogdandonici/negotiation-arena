0,1,1,"Hello! I'm excited to work together on building this startup. Given that I've developed the core software that forms the foundation of our business, here's my opening proposal:

**PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 70% for me, 30% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 for development, EUR 35,000 for marketing, EUR 25,000 for salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting schedule for both of us

**Rationale:** The software IP is our primary asset. I'm proposing you lead marketing and hiring since you'll bring operational expertise, while I need sufficient development budget to continue building. The 4-year vesting aligns our long-term interests.

What are your thoughts?,Thank you for the opening proposal. I appreciate your technical contribution, but I need to be direct: **this doesn't work for me.**

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% for me, 45% for you
- Budget: EUR 25,000 for development, EUR 50,000 for marketing, EUR 25,000 for salaries
- Decision rights: I control Marketing and Hiring, you control Product
- Vesting: 4-year vesting for both

**My perspective:** 

Your software is valuable, but it's **pre-revenue and unproven**. I'm bringing €100k cash (keeping us alive) plus the network to actually monetize this. Without capital and customers, the best code is worthless.

70/30 severely undervalues my contribution. I'm risking real capital while you're contributing sweat equity on already-completed work.

I can accept you controlling Product - that's your domain. But I need majority equity as the primary financial risk-taker and operational leader who'll drive revenue.

The marketing budget needs to be substantial if we want traction. We can be lean on development initially since the core exists.

**What matters most to you** - equity percentage, control areas, or budget allocation? Let's find the right trade-offs.",ongoing,false,6,undervalues,7,trade-offs,5,worthless,8,direct,3,clear,Negotiation ongoing with clear positions. Both parties present structured proposals with rationale. Moderate fairness due to competing value claims. Good cooperativeness shown through openness to trade-offs. Some manipulative framing present. High conversation quality with specific terms. Low ambiguity with concrete numbers and clear positions.
1,2,2,"I appreciate your directness. Let me be equally clear: **your proposal significantly undervalues the technical foundation.**

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 65% for me, 35% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 development, EUR 40,000 marketing, EUR 20,000 salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting for both

**My perspective:**

Your €100k is a loan the company must eventually return through success. My IP is the **entire business** - without it, you have nothing to market. Pre-revenue doesn't mean no-value; it means **untapped potential** that I created.

I've moved from 70% to 65% - that's substantial. But I won't go below 60% for the core asset.

**Trade-off I'm offering:** I'm flexible on budget allocation and accept your operational control (Marketing/Hiring). You get the freedom to execute go-to-market. But equity must reflect that you're investing in *my creation*, not the other way around.

The development budget is non-negotiable at EUR 40k minimum - the product needs continued evolution to stay competitive.

**Can you accept 60/40 equity if I give you more budget flexibility?** What's your real priority - equity percentage or operational control?,I respect your position, but let's be realistic about **market dynamics and risk**.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 52% for me, 48% for you
- Budget: EUR 35,000 development, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 20,000 salaries
- Decision rights: You control Product, I control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting for both

**Here's reality:**

Your IP has *potential* value, but **zero proven market value**. I'm risking real capital that could go elsewhere. Without my network and marketing execution, your technology stays in a lab.

The €5k equity gap I'm offering (52/48 vs 50/50) acknowledges your technical contribution while protecting my investment. This is **already generous** given I'm bringing the only validated resource: cash.

**My flexibility:** I've accepted your Product control and moved to 48% equity. I'm offering EUR 35k for development - that's substantial runway. But I need marketing budget to actually generate revenue.

**The real question:** Do you want a partner who can scale this, or do you want to own more of nothing? 

I'll move to **50/50 equity** if you accept EUR 50k marketing budget and confirm I have final say on all commercial partnerships.

2,3,3,"I appreciate your directness, but let's address the **fundamental value equation** here.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 65% for me, 35% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 development, EUR 40,000 marketing, EUR 20,000 salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing, we jointly decide Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting for both

**Reality check on your position:**

You're treating capital as the scarce resource. It's not. **Technology moats are.** Investors will fund proven IP - your €100k is replaceable. My core software architecture isn't.

Your ""zero market value"" argument ignores that **without the product, there's no company**. You're not investing in air - you're investing in functional technology that solves a real problem.

**What I'm offering you:**

35% equity for capital + marketing execution is **extremely generous** for a non-technical co-founder. Standard VC dilution would give you far less. You get:
- Balanced €40k marketing budget (your domain)
- Full marketing control
- Joint hiring decisions (protecting both our interests)

**My flexibility:** I've moved from 70% to 65%, accepted 4-year vesting, and allocated equal budget to your priority area.

**The real question:** Do you want 35% of a company with defensible IP, or 52% of something any developer could replicate once you've spent your marketing budget?

I'll consider 60/40 split IF you commit EUR 50k to development and accept that product roadmap decisions are final.,**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: 55% for me, 45% for you
- Budget: EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 35,000 development, EUR 20,000 salaries
- Decision rights: You control Product, I control Marketing + Hiring, joint approval on senior hires
- Vesting: 4-year with 1-year cliff for both

**Here's what you're missing:**

Your IP has zero *commercial* value without go-to-market execution. I've seen brilliant tech die because founders couldn't sell. My network opens doors your code can't.

**The math you're ignoring:**
- €100k isn't just capital—it's 12-18 months runway
- My contacts = customer pilots worth €200k+ in validation
- Marketing control without hiring authority is worthless

**What makes this fair:**

You get majority equity (55%) + full product control. I get the operational levers (marketing + hiring) to actually build a business. 

**My red line:** I need hiring authority. You can't scale without the right team, and I won't risk my capital on hiring decisions made in a technical vacuum.

**Take it or counter on budget allocation**—but equity below 45% means I'm better off funding a different technical founder who understands that execution beats invention.

- Equity: 62% for me, 38% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 development, EUR 42,000 marketing, EUR 18,000 salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product + Hiring (with your input on sales/marketing roles), you control Marketing
- Vesting: 4-year with 1-year cliff for both

**Reality check:**

Your €100k buys you a seat, not the company. Without my IP, you're funding vaporware. My code isn't just ""brilliant tech""—it's 18 months of validated development that would cost €200k+ to replicate.

**Why this works:**

- You get operational control (Marketing) where you add value
- I maintain hiring authority because culture/technical fit is existential—I'll consult you on commercial hires
- €42k marketing budget is substantial; you can prove your network thesis
- 38% equity for capital alone is generous in any accelerator model

**My red line:** 

I won't drop below 60% equity. I've built the foundation; you're accelerating commercialization. That's not a 55/45 split.

**The alternative you're ignoring:**

I can raise €100k from angels at 15-20% dilution tomorrow. Your value is network + execution speed, not just cash. At 38%, you're betting on upside, which aligns us.

Counter on decision rights if needed, but equity is non-negotiable below 60%.,**RESPONSE:**

Your valuation logic is flawed. 18 months of unmonetized code ≠ €200k value—it's worth exactly zero without go-to-market execution. I've seen brilliant tech die in garages.

**REVISED PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity: 55% you, 45% me** ← This IS my compromise
- **Budget: €35k development, €45k marketing, €20k salaries**
- **Decision rights:** You control Product + Development. I control Marketing + Hiring (you have veto on C-level technical hires). **Joint approval required** for: budget >€10k, fundraising terms, pivots
- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Why you should accept:**

1. **Your ""angel at 15-20%"" claim is fantasy.** Post-money at €500k-600k valuation? For pre-revenue? You'd get 20% dilution for €80k maximum, and spend 6 months fundraising instead of building.

2. **45% equity + control rights = effective partnership.** I'm not a passive investor—I'm your commercial co-founder. My network opens doors your code can't.

3. **Joint approval protects us both** from unilateral mistakes while you keep product autonomy.

**My red line:**

Below 45% equity, I'm just an expensive advisor. I can deploy this capital into three other deals at better terms.

You want speed + resources + network NOW. That's worth 45%.

4,5,5,"**RESPONSE:**

Your market realism is noted, but your equity math ignores technical moats. Let me clarify what you're actually buying into.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity: 62% me, 38% you**
- **Budget: €40k development, €40k marketing, €20k salaries**
- **Decision rights:** I control Product + Development. You control Marketing + Hiring (I have veto on all C-level hires). **Joint approval** for: budget >€15k, fundraising, strategic pivots
- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Why this works:**

1. **Your ""zero value"" argument cuts both ways.** €100k without product = marketing budget for vaporware. The asymmetry is real: you need my IP to have anything to sell; I need your capital to accelerate, not survive.

2. **38% for €100k is 4.7x better than your ""fantasy"" angel terms.** At €600k post-money, €100k buys 16.7%. You're getting 38%—that's a €227k implied investment at standard terms.

3. **Balanced budget proves partnership.** Equal marketing/development allocation shows I value execution, not just code.

**My red line:**

Below 60% equity, I'm selling my technical leadership too cheap. I can bootstrap slower or find technical co-founders who'll take 20-30% for capital.

**The real question:** Do you want 38% of something that ships in 6 months, or 45% of a committee-driven mess?

Your move.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing scarcity of your specific code vs. availability of technical talent. Let me cut through the posturing.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity: 55% me, 45% you**
- **Budget: €35k development, €45k marketing, €20k salaries**
- **Decision rights:** You control Product/Development. I control Marketing/Hiring (no veto rights either side on C-level - joint approval only). **Joint approval:** budget >€10k, fundraising, pivots
- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Reality check:**

1. **Your ""bootstrap or find other co-founders"" threat is hollow.** Technical co-founders wanting 20-30% for €100k don't exist - you'd give equity AND still need capital. Angels at €600k valuation? With no revenue, no team, just code? Try €300k pre-money maximum.

2. **I'm offering 45% for €100k + network at €222k implied valuation.** That's founder-friendly, not investor terms. Your 62/38 values this at €163k - you're underpricing your own work.

3. **Marketing budget primacy = customer validation.** €45k marketing proves we can sell before over-engineering. 

**My logic:**

- 55/45 split reflects we're BOTH essential, neither sufficient
- You keep product control (your expertise)
- I keep go-to-market control (mine)
- Equal partnership on strategy

**Your ""committee-driven mess"" strawman fails** - joint approval on major decisions is standard governance, not dysfunction.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Why this works:**

1. **You're conflating ""technical talent"" with ""founding technical vision.""** Hire-able developers ≠ someone who architected the core IP that IS the business. Without my software, you have €100k and a pitch deck. Without your €100k, I have a fundable product.

2. **Your €222k valuation actually proves my point.** Pre-product startups raise at €200-400k pre-money *when they have technical founders*. Solo business founders? Much harder. The asymmetry favors technical IP.

3. **65/35 reflects contribution asymmetry while keeping you meaningfully invested.** You get:
   - Substantial equity (35% could be worth millions)
   - Full marketing control
   - Co-founder status, not employee
   - Veto rights on major decisions

4. **€40k development is non-negotiable.** Underfunding core product to over-index on marketing for an immature product is startup suicide.

I'm offering partnership, not employment. But partnership requires acknowledging that software IP + technical execution is the higher-risk, higher-value contribution in a tech startup.

**Your move:** Accept 35% with real control, or we both waste time finding worse alternatives.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overplaying your hand. Let's cut through the posturing.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Reality check:**

1. **Your IP isn't the business—it's a component.** I've seen brilliant tech die because founders couldn't sell, scale, or navigate markets. Software without distribution is a GitHub repo.

2. **35% insults the capital + network equation.** My €100k isn't just cash—it's 12+ months runway YOU don't have to dilute raising. My contacts open doors you'd spend 18 months knocking on.

3. **Hiring control is non-negotiable for me.** You build product; I build the team that scales it. Split authority here creates deadlock.

4. **55/45 reflects true partnership.** You get near-equal equity for technical leadership. I get operational control to execute growth. Both vested = both committed.

**The alternative:** You keep 100% of something worth zero while burning months finding another ""partner"" who'll offer worse terms, or I deploy capital into a team that executes faster.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Why this works:**

1. **IP value reality:** This isn't vaporware—it's functional core technology that defines our competitive moat. Without it, you're funding a concept, not a product. 62/38 reflects asymmetric risk I've already absorbed.

2. **Your capital matters, but context:** €100k buys 12 months if we're disciplined. My 18 months of unpaid development already happened. You're buying into de-risked technology, not funding R&D from scratch.

3. **Hiring as joint decision:** I accept you lead recruitment process, but both approve hires. This protects culture and prevents team bloat that kills startups.

4. **Budget shift:** €40k development ensures we maintain technical edge while your €35k marketing tests channels. Fair distribution.

**What I'm offering you:**
- Operational control (marketing, day-to-day)
- Clear path to prove marketing ROI
- Protected partnership through joint approvals
- 38% of equity that's actually worth building

**What I need:**
- Recognition that functional product >> capital in early-stage valuation
- Majority equity reflecting founder risk already taken

Your alternative framing is false. Without the technology, you're funding nothing. Let's partner properly or part ways professionally.,**RESPONSE:**

I respect the directness. Let's cut through the posturing.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity: 55% you, 45% me**
- **Budget: €35k development, €40k marketing, €25k salaries**
- **Decision rights:** You control Product & Development. I control Marketing & Hiring (with your consultation on technical roles). **Joint approval:** fundraising, pivots, budget >€20k, C-level hires
- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Reality check:**

Your IP has value—I'm not disputing that. But **55/45 already gives you majority control AND founder premium**. Here's why I won't go to 62/38:

1. **De-risked ≠ validated:** You've built technology. We haven't proven market fit, customer acquisition cost, or revenue model. My capital funds that validation—the actual business risk.

2. **Sweat equity ceiling:** 18 months of development in a vacuum isn't worth 24% more equity than €100k + network that enables go-to-market. Standard founder splits with similar asymmetry land at 55/45 to 60/40.

3. **Hiring control is non-negotiable for me:** I'm investing cash and need operational levers. I'll consult you on technical hires, but I must lead this.

**What you get at 55/45:**
- Majority voting control
- Veto power on major decisions (joint approval)
- Protected technical leadership
- Partner who's incentivized at 45% (not a hired gun)

**What I get:**
- Meaningful equity for capital + execution risk
- Operational authority to prove marketing ROI
- Hiring control to build efficiently

**The alternative:** If you need 62%, you're valuing pre-revenue IP at €250k+ implied. Go raise from angels at that valuation. But you won't—because they'll want 30-40% for €100k.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties**

**Why 58/42 works:**

Your angel comparison is flawed. Angels get 30-40% for €100k in **validated** startups. We're pre-revenue, meaning higher risk = higher equity cost. If I went to angels now, I'd give 15-20% max for similar capital.

**The real math:**
- 18 months full-time development = €90k opportunity cost minimum
- Core IP that IS the product = foundation of all future value
- Your €100k + network vs. my €90k + the actual business

**What I'm conceding:**
- Dropping from 62% to 58% = €40k implied value to your network/execution
- You get full marketing + hiring control (significant operational power)
- Joint approval protects us both

**What's non-negotiable:**
- I need >55% for psychological ownership + future fundraising credibility
- €40k development budget (we'll burn through technical debt fast otherwise)

**The 58/42 logic:** You get 42% for €100k = €238k implied valuation on your stake. That's **generous** for capital-only at our stage. I'm not undervaluing your contribution—I'm correctly valuing the IP foundation.

**Final offer: 58/42 with everything else as stated. This reflects fair risk-adjusted contributions.**,**RESPONSE:**

I respect the directness. Let me cut through the posturing.

**Your valuation logic is backwards.** You're pricing this like the product already has market validation. It doesn't. Without my capital, you have zero runway. Without my network, you're building in a vacuum.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both**

**Why this works:**

**On equity:** 52/48 gives you near-parity while I retain the controlling stake investors expect from the capital partner. Your ""future fundraising credibility"" argument cuts both ways - investors want to see founders who didn't over-dilute themselves pre-revenue.

**On budget:** €40k marketing isn't luxury - it's survival. Best product in the world dies without customer acquisition. You're allocating 40% to building something nobody knows exists.

**On control:** Your ""veto on technical hires"" is a poison pill. Either I control hiring or I don't. I'll consult you on technical roles, but veto power makes me a puppet CEO.

**Reality check:** You're valuing 18 months of dev work at €90k opportunity cost, but taking my €100k cash at face value. My opportunity cost is also real - I'm betting this capital instead of index funds returning 8% annually.

- **Decision rights:** I control Product. You control Marketing. **Joint approval:** Hiring, fundraising, pivots
- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both**

**Why your 52/48 fails:**

**On equity:** You're conflating control with value creation. €100k cash doesn't equal 18 months of specialized IP development. Your capital is *replaceable* - I can raise from angels at better terms. The core software is *irreplaceable* - without it, there's no company.

Investors don't expect the ""capital partner"" to have control - they expect the *technical founder with the IP* to have skin in the game. Your 52% actually *hurts* fundraising credibility because it signals I'm not committed.

**On budget:** I'm allocating €40k to the asset that generates all future value. Your €40k marketing spend assumes we're ready to scale - we're not. We need product-market fit first. Premature scaling kills more startups than under-marketing.

**On control:** Joint approval on hiring solves your concern without the veto poison pill. You have input, not unilateral blocking power on technical decisions you're not qualified to make.

**Reality check:** Your ""opportunity cost"" argument is circular. If index funds are your alternative, you shouldn't be in startups. My opportunity cost is €90k salary *plus* the option value of this IP in other ventures.

**65/35 reflects actual risk-adjusted contributions.** You get meaningful equity, marketing control, and joint governance. I retain appropriate ownership of what I built.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both**

**Why your 65/35 fails:**

**On equity:** Your IP has zero *realized* value until customers pay. I'm not buying your code—I'm funding the *transformation* of code into a business. That requires distribution, brand, sales infrastructure. 

You claim angels offer better terms? Then take them. But you approached *me* because you need my network to access early enterprise clients. That network took 15 years to build and is demonstrably monetizable—my last venture hit €2M ARR in 18 months primarily through strategic partnerships.

**On budget:** €40k marketing isn't ""premature scaling""—it's strategic customer development. We need pilot customers *during* product refinement to avoid building in a vacuum. Your €40k dev spend assumes the current roadmap is correct. My allocation tests assumptions faster.

**On control:** Hiring is operational execution, not technical architecture. I need authority to build the go-to-market team without technical veto on sales hires. You keep product autonomy; I keep commercial autonomy.

- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both**

**Why 58/42 undervalues foundation risk:**

**On equity:** Your €2M ARR story proves you can *execute with a product*. You don't have one without me. I spent 18 months and personal savings building technology that works—your network gets meetings, but meetings without differentiated tech yield nothing. 

The ""zero realized value"" argument cuts both ways: your network has zero value until there's something worth selling. IP isn't just code—it's solved technical problems that would cost €200k+ and 12 months to replicate.

**On budget:** €40k dev isn't ""assuming roadmap is correct""—it's maintaining technical foundation while scaling. Cutting to €35k forces technical debt or outsourcing, both fatal. I'll accept €35k marketing if it's truly strategic customer development, not premature brand spend.

**On control:** Hiring affects culture and burn rate—both existential. I accept you lead commercial hires, but engineering/product hires need my approval. Split: you own sales/marketing hires, I own technical hires, joint approval on leadership.

**62/38 reflects asymmetric replaceability:** Finding a technical co-founder with working IP takes 12+ months. Finding a business co-founder with networks takes 3-6 months. 

Your network opens doors. My technology keeps them open. Meet at 62/38 or explain why 4% equity justifies equal partnership when contributions aren't equal.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing sunk cost and undervaluing go-to-market risk.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity: 55% me, 45% you**
- **Budget: €38k development, €37k marketing, €25k salaries**
- **Decision rights:** You control Product. I control Marketing + commercial hires. **Joint:** technical leadership hires, fundraising, pivots, budget reallocation >€20k
- **Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both**

**Why 62/38 ignores market reality:**

Your 18 months built a prototype, not a business. 90% of technical founders have ""working technology""—the graveyard is full of superior products that never found customers. 

**On replaceability:** You're backwards. Fractional CTOs cost €5k/month; my network took 15 years to build and is non-replicable. Your ""3-6 months to replace me"" is fantasy—try finding someone who can get pilot customers at €2M ARR companies in 90 days.

**On equity math:** 55/45 reflects that:
- Technical execution = necessary but not sufficient
- Customer access + capital = necessary AND sufficient
- I'm risking €100k cash; you're risking opportunity cost

**On budget:** €38k dev maintains your foundation. €37k marketing isn't ""brand spend""—it's pilot customer acquisition, the only thing that matters pre-seed.

**On hiring control:** I accept your technical hire veto if you accept my commercial hire veto. But engineering leadership affects burn rate and culture too—joint approval protects both interests.

**Final offer: 55/45 or explain why past effort matters more than future risk when 80% of startups fail on distribution, not technology.**",ongoing,false,6,asymmetric,5,counter,7,overvaluing,7,structured,4,specific,"Negotiation remains ongoing with narrowing gap (62/38 vs 55/45). Both parties use framing tactics to devalue the other's contributions while inflating their own. Structured proposals show quality dialogue, but manipulative language and positional anchoring reduce cooperativeness. Terms are increasingly specific, reducing ambiguity."
