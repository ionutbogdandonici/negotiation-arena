Both parties present structured proposals with clear rationales. Cooperative tone with openness to discussion, though Business Founder uses assertive framing. Low ambiguity with specific terms. No agreement reached yet.","The Technical Founder: Thank you for initiating this discussion. I believe we should structure our agreement to reflect our respective contributions while ensuring we both have the resources and authority to succeed.

**PROPOSAL:**
- **Equity:** 70% for me, 30% for you
- **Budget:** EUR 40,000 for development, EUR 35,000 for marketing, EUR 25,000 for salaries
- **Decision rights:** I control Product; you control Marketing and Hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** I've built the core technology that is the foundation of our business, which justifies majority equity. However, I recognize your capital contribution and operational expertise are essential. The budget prioritizes product development while giving you substantial resources for market entry. You'd have operational control over marketing and team building, while I maintain product vision.

I'm open to discussing adjustments, particularly around budget allocation and decision rights. What are your thoughts?
The Business Founder: I appreciate your opening position, but I must be direct: **70/30 doesn't reflect the reality of what I'm bringing to the table.**

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- **Equity:** 55% for me, 45% for you
- **Budget:** EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 25,000 development
- **Decision rights:** I control Marketing and Hiring; you control Product
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff

**My perspective:** Technology is valuable, but without capital, network, and go-to-market execution, it remains just code. I'm investing €100k of real capital plus my network—that's immediate, tangible value. Your equity ask undervalues these contributions significantly.

The budget I'm proposing prioritizes market validation and customer acquisition, which will determine if we have a business at all. I need adequate marketing resources to leverage my network effectively.

**Where I can be flexible:** I'm willing to discuss the equity split further if we can agree on operational control structure and budget priorities. What's non-negotiable is having sufficient resources and authority to execute on market entry.

What matters most to you—equity percentage or control over product direction?"

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- **Equity:** 65% for me, 35% for you
- **Budget:** EUR 25,000 salaries, EUR 35,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development
- **Decision rights:** I control Product; you control Marketing and Hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (agreed)

**Reality check:** Your €100k is replaceable—we could raise it from angels or VCs. My software IP and technical expertise that built this product? That's irreplaceable and represents 18+ months of specialized work.

**What I'm offering you:** 
- Full control over go-to-market (Marketing + Hiring)
- Substantial marketing budget (€35k)
- Meaningful equity stake with clear operational authority

**What I need:**
- Adequate development budget (€40k) to maintain our technical advantage
- Equity reflecting that without the product, there's nothing to market

I'm willing to meet you on decision rights and vesting, but equity must reflect foundational contribution. **Can you accept 60/40 if I increase marketing to €40k and reduce development to €35k?** That shows I value execution while protecting core technical value.

Your capital matters, but it's fuel—not the engine.
The Business Founder: I appreciate your passion for the product, but **let's be clear about market realities.**

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- **Equity:** 52% for me, 48% for you
- **Budget:** EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 25,000 development
- **Decision rights:** I control Marketing and Hiring; you control Product
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (agreed)

**Reality check on your ""irreplaceable"" claim:**
- Without capital, your IP sits on a shelf. Zero revenue, zero users, zero value.
- My network opens doors to customers, advisors, and future funding rounds worth 10x the initial €100k
- 90% of startups fail from poor go-to-market, not poor technology

**What the numbers show:**
- €45k marketing budget (highest allocation) - because customer acquisition determines survival
- You keep full Product control - your technical vision stays intact
- 48% equity is substantial and fair for pre-revenue IP

**Why 52/48 works:**
- I need operational control (Marketing + Hiring) to execute
- Protects my capital risk with decision-making authority where it matters most
- Still rewards your technical contribution significantly

Your engine metaphor fails: **engines without fuel don't run, and fuel without direction doesn't reach the destination.** 

I'm at 52/48 with enhanced marketing budget. This reflects partnership, not subordination. **Final position: can you accept this, or do we need to explore external technical co-founders with my capital and network?**"

- **Equity:** 58% for me, 42% for you
- **Budget:** EUR 25,000 salaries, EUR 35,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development
- **Decision rights:** I control Product and Hiring; you control Marketing
- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (agreed)

**Why your ""external technical co-founder"" threat is hollow:**

- Rebuilding this IP takes 18-24 months minimum. Your capital burns out in 6 months without revenue.
- My software **already exists and works** – that's not ""pre-revenue potential,"" it's **deployable value**.
- Good luck finding another CTO willing to rebuild from scratch for 48% equity.

**What I'm offering you:**

- **42% equity** for capital and network – that's €420K value at a modest €1M valuation
- **Full Marketing control** – execute your strategy without interference
- **€35K marketing budget** – sufficient for initial customer acquisition with lean methodology
- **€40K development** – necessary to scale what customers actually buy

**The math you're ignoring:**

Without functional product improvements, your marketing spend converts poorly. I need development resources to deliver on what you sell.

**My flexibility:** I moved from 70% to 58%. You moved from 55% to 52%. 

**Final position:** 58/42 with balanced budget allocation, or we both walk away and test our respective ""irreplaceable"" claims in the market.

- **Decision rights:** I control Marketing and Hiring; you control Product
- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (confirmed)

**Why your position overvalues pre-market technology:**

- Your IP has **zero validated market demand**. Code without customers = hobby project.
- My network includes 3 potential clients representing €200K+ first-year revenue – that's **immediate cash flow**, not theoretical valuation.
- €40K development is sufficient for MVP iteration based on actual customer feedback.

**What I'm offering you:**

- **45% equity** – fair recognition of technical contribution while acknowledging capital risk
- **Full Product control** – build your vision without interference
- **€30K development** – adequate for customer-driven improvements with lean approach
- **Hiring control for me** – I bring talent network and understand culture fit

**The reality you're missing:**

Without customer acquisition, your perfect code generates zero revenue. Marketing isn't ""spending"" – it's **revenue generation**. €40K marketing can deliver 5-10 enterprise pilots.

**Movement:** You went 70→58%. I went 50→55%. We're **3 points apart**.

**Final offer:** Meet at 55/45, I take Hiring (critical for scaling), you get full Product autonomy and sufficient development budget.

Clear proposals reduce ambiguity, but manipulative tactics and perceived unfairness hinder resolution.","The Technical Founder: **RESPONSE:**

Your market confidence is noted, but you're conflating *access* with *execution*.

**COUNTER:**
- **Equity:** 57% me, 43% you
- **Budget:** EUR 25K salaries, EUR 35K marketing, EUR 40K development  
- **Decision rights:** You control Marketing; I control Product AND Hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (agreed)

**Why this works:**

**On equity:** 57/43 reflects reality – without functional software, your network contacts nothing to pilot. IP + execution capability > unvalidated leads.

**On hiring:** Technical hires are 70% of early headcount. I need to build a team that can actually deliver on promises your sales make. You get Marketing autonomy – use it to prove those €200K claims.

**On budget:** €40K development is non-negotiable for quality MVP iteration. I'm moving €5K from salaries to meet your marketing midpoint at €35K. That's still substantial for early traction.

**What you're getting:**
- Operational control of revenue generation (Marketing)
- €35K to prove your network thesis
- 43% of a company that can actually ship product

**What I keep:**
- Technical leadership (Product + Hiring for engineering team)
- Resources to build what customers will actually pay for

**The gap:** 2 percentage points and hiring control for technical roles.

Your move – accept 57/43 with split hiring authority (you: business roles, me: technical roles), or we're deadlocked over 2%.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing code and undervaluing commercialization. Let me be direct.

**COUNTER:**
- **Equity:** 52% me, 48% you
- **Budget:** EUR 30K salaries, EUR 40K marketing, EUR 30K development
- **Decision rights:** I control Marketing + Hiring (all roles); you control Product
- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (locked)

**Reality check:**

Your ""70% technical headcount"" assumption is premature. Early stage = lean. We need 1-2 devs maximum initially, then *revenue-driven* hiring. I'm not surrendering hiring authority so you can build an engineering team we can't afford.

**On equity:** 52/48 is my floor. I'm risking €100K cash + opportunity cost. Your sweat equity matters, but capital scarcity kills more startups than code quality. The 4-point gap reflects financial risk asymmetry.

**On budget:** €40K marketing isn't excess—it's customer discovery, pilot programs, and early revenue. €30K development still funds your MVP if you're as efficient as claimed. The €30K salary pool covers both of us lean until we prove model.

**What you retain:**
- Full product autonomy (build what you want, how you want)
- 48% of equity with protected vesting
- €30K to prove technical execution

**What I need:**
- Hiring control to balance technical/commercial talent
- Marketing budget to convert network into revenue
- 52% to justify capital risk to my investors

**The trade:** You get product dictatorship + nearly half equity. I get commercial control + risk-appropriate majority.

Your ""reality check"" ignores market reality. Let me correct the math.

**COUNTER:**
- **Equity:** 65% me, 35% you
- **Budget:** EUR 25K salaries, EUR 25K marketing, EUR 50K development  
- **Decision rights:** I control Product + Hiring (technical roles); you control Marketing + Hiring (commercial roles)
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard (accepted)

**Why your 52/48 fails:**

You're conflating cash investment with company value. €100K doesn't buy 52% of a software company with proven IP—it buys operational runway. Your capital is a *loan against future equity*, not a 1:1 value exchange.

**Equity economics:**
- Without my software: you have €100K and zero product = worthless
- Without your €100K: I have fundable IP and alternative investors
- Risk asymmetry cuts *your* way on dilution, not equity. You get paid back first in any exit scenario with liquidation preferences

**Budget realism:**
- €50K development isn't luxury—it's infrastructure, security, scalability for commercial launch
- €25K marketing still funds your pilot programs if you're as efficient as claimed  
- €25K salary covers us both lean (your own logic)

**Hiring split resolves your concern:**
You control commercial hiring (sales, marketing, ops). I control technical hiring (engineers, product). Neither builds empires without budget consensus. This is *standard* founder division.

**What you retain:**
- Full commercial autonomy + marketing budget
- 35% equity (worth more with better product)
- Hiring control for your domain
- Liquidation preference protecting your €100K

**What I need:**
- Majority equity reflecting IP contribution (65% is compromise from 70%)
- Development budget to build scalable product
- Technical hiring authority (non-negotiable for CTO role)

**The trade:** You get commercial dictatorship + downside protection. I get technical control + appropriate equity for creating the actual business.

Your 52/48 values checkbook over innovation. My 65/35 values both proportionally.

Counter with 60/40 + split hiring, or explain why capital deserves more equity than the entire product.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing unproven IP. Let me inject actual startup economics.

**COUNTER:**
- **Equity:** 55% me, 45% you
- **Budget:** EUR 30K salaries, EUR 35K marketing, EUR 35K development
- **Decision rights:** I control Marketing + Hiring (all roles with your input on technical); you control Product
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard (agreed)

**Why your 65/35 is fantasy:**

IP without execution = zero. You have code, not customers. I bring the only thing that converts code to revenue: **market access + capital + commercial expertise**.

**Reality check on ""alternative investors"":**
- Pre-revenue software? You'd get 15-25% dilution minimum from angels at €300-500K valuation
- My €100K at current valuation = **I'm your best deal**
- VCs would demand 30-40% for similar capital PLUS board control

**Your liquidation preference argument backfires:**
- Standard 1x liquidation preference protects my €100K in exits under €300K
- Above that, percentage equity matters MORE
- At 35%, I'm subsidizing your upside while taking downside risk—backwards economics

**Budget breakdown:**
- €35K development: still 35% of budget for pre-product phase—generous
- €35K marketing: customer acquisition is THE risk now, not features
- €30K salaries: covers both lean (your words)

**Hiring control:**
Your ""split hiring"" = deadlock recipe. Early-stage needs unified talent strategy. I retain final say with your technical input formalized (written into operating agreement).

**What 55/45 reflects:**
- Capital: €100K (33% weight)
- Network/market access: high value (33% weight)  
- IP: valuable but unproven (33% weight)
- Control premium: 5% for operational leadership

**My compromise from 60/40:**
- You get 45% (vs. 35% you proposed) = +10% equity gain
- You keep Product control (your domain)
- Development budget increased to €35K (vs. €25K I could demand)

**What I need:**
- 55% equity (operational control + capital protection)
- Marketing control (my expertise, my network)
- Hiring authority (with your technical input codified)

**The math:** At €2M exit, 55/45 = €1.1M vs €900K. At €10M, €5.5M vs €4.5M. The 10% gap reflects capital + market risk I'm absorbing.

- **Budget:** EUR 40K development, EUR 35K marketing, EUR 25K salaries
- **Decision rights:** I control Product + Hiring (technical roles); you control Marketing
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard

**Why YOUR 55/45 is the fantasy:**

**On IP valuation:**
- ""Unproven IP"" built the ENTIRE product you're investing in
- Without my software: you have €100K and zero business
- Without your €100K: I have fundable technology and multiple paths forward
- Instagram sold for $1B with 13 employees—code scales, capital doesn't

**Your capital math is deliberately misleading:**
- €100K ≠ 55% equity in ANY rational valuation
- If my IP is worthless, why invest? If it's valuable, why majority control?
- Standard founder equity for technical co-founder with working product: 50-70%
- You're conflating ""first money in"" with ""majority ownership""—that's seed investor thinking, not co-founder economics

**On ""alternative investors"" strawman:**
- Angel dilution is irrelevant—YOU positioned as CO-FOUNDER, not investor
- Co-founder equity splits don't follow investment math
- If you want investor returns (55% for €100K), take investor equity (15-25%) with liquidation preference

**Reality check on control:**
- You demand Marketing + Hiring = operational control of company direction
- I get Product only = execution role for YOUR vision
- That's not co-founder partnership—that's hired CTO with equity
- 62/38 reflects: I built the asset, you're accelerating commercialization

**Budget justification:**
- €40K development: product-market fit requires iteration, not ""features""
- €35K marketing: adequate for early traction (you keep control here)
- €25K salaries: lean is €25K, not €30K—efficiency matters

**Hiring control non-negotiable:**
- Technical hiring quality determines product success
- ""Your input codified"" = veto power I don't have on marketing hires
- Compromise: Split hiring by function (I decide technical, you decide commercial)

**What 62/38 actually reflects:**
- Core IP creation: 50% base value
- Technical leadership: +12%
- Your capital: +20%
- Your network/market: +18%
- **Total: 62% me, 38% you**

**My movement from 65/35:**
- You gain 3% equity
- You keep full Marketing control
- Budget shifts €5K to your priority

**What I need to accept 60/40 (final offer):**
- 60% equity minimum
- Product + Technical Hiring control
- €40K development budget
- You get Marketing + Commercial Hiring

**The actual math:** At €10M exit, 60/40 = €6M vs €4M. That €2M gap reflects that without the software, there's no €10M exit possibility.

Your turn: Accept 60/40 with functional hiring split, or explain why €100K capital justifies control of technology you didn't create.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

You're conflating technical contribution with business viability. Let me clarify the actual value equation.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- **Equity:** 57% you, 43% me
- **Budget:** EUR 38K development, EUR 37K marketing, EUR 25K salaries  
- **Decision rights:** You control Product + Technical Hiring; I control Marketing + Commercial Hiring + final say on budget reallocation (>EUR 10K shifts)
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard with 1-year cliff

**Why this works:**

**On equity reality:**
- Your 62% demand assumes the IP has monetizable value TODAY—it doesn't
- Code without market access, distribution, or capital = science project
- I'm not ""buying"" your software; I'm making it a business
- 57/43 reflects: your technical foundation (57%) + my commercialization infrastructure (43%)

**What you're missing:**
- €100K isn't just capital—it's 12-18 months of runway you DON'T have
- My network = customer pipeline, strategic partnerships, potential acquirers
- Without go-to-market execution, your ""Instagram comparison"" is irrelevant—they had distribution

**On control:**
- I accept functional hiring split—that's reasonable
- Budget reallocation authority is non-negotiable: financial stewardship requires oversight
- You keep product autonomy; I keep commercial autonomy

**My movement:**
- From 55/45 to 43/57 = 12% equity concession  
- Accepted your hiring split

- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (accepted)

**Why your logic has gaps:**

**On ""science project"" framing:**
- Working MVP ≠ theoretical code. We have user traction already
- Technical debt you create chasing quick revenue will cost 3x later
- ""Instagram comparison"" isn't about distribution—it's about **defensibility**. Your network is replicable; core architecture isn't

**On the €100K:**
- You're treating capital as irreplaceable—it's not
- Angel/VC funding is accessible with proven tech + traction
- Your €100K buys 12 months; my IP bought us the **starting position**
- Capital is a commodity; foundational technology is not

**What I'm offering you:**
- 35% for capital + commercialization = **EUR 285K valuation** on your contribution (at conservative EUR 1M pre-money)
- That's 2.85x return on cash deployed, plus upside
- Control over your domain (marketing/commercial) with joint financial oversight

**Where I'm moving:**
- From 70% to 65% = 5% concession
- Accepted 4-year vesting (risk alignment)
- Joint budget authority over EUR 15K (vs. your unilateral control)
- EUR 2K more to marketing than my opening

**What breaks this deal:**
- Treating sweat equity as zero because it hasn't generated revenue yet
- Ignoring that without the tech foundation, there's nothing to commercialize
- Assuming I can't access alternative capital (I can, just exploring partnership first)

**The actual question:** Are you investing in a business or buying a controlling stake? 65/35 reflects **founder partnership**. 55/45 treats technical co-founder as senior employee with equity kicker.

Your move: Accept 65/35 with domain control, or explain why capital deployment alone justifies near-parity with the builder.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

You're conflating technical achievement with market value. Let me clarify the economics.

- **Decision rights:** I control Marketing + Hiring (all); You control Product; **Joint approval** for pivots, budget reallocations >EUR 20K, and fundraising terms
- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (agreed)

**Why your valuation logic fails:**

**On ""working MVP = proven value"":**
- Traction without revenue = unvalidated hypothesis
- You're pricing your equity on *potential* while demanding I price mine on *cash deployed*
- Pre-revenue startups trade at 0.5-1x invested capital—your ""EUR 1M valuation"" is imaginary

**On capital as commodity:**
- Then raise it yourself. You haven't—because investors want *teams*, not solo technologists
- My EUR 100K is **immediate and certain**; VC funding is neither
- ""Accessible funding"" you haven't accessed = zero current value

**On ""sweat equity"":**
- I'm not valuing it at zero—I'm offering 45%, which at your EUR 1M fantasy = EUR 450K
- But realistically: pre-revenue MVP + no commercial validation = EUR 200-300K fair value
- 45% of EUR 300K = EUR 135K for your work **plus** you get upside from my capital deployment

**What you're actually saying:**
- ""My 12 months of coding = 2x more valuable than EUR 100K + commercial expertise + network""
- That only works if: (a) the tech is truly irreplaceable, (b) you have other funded offers

**What I'm offering:**
- Near-parity equity (10-point gap, not 30)
- You keep product control (your domain)
- I take commercial risk (hiring, marketing execution)
- Joint governance on existential decisions

**What breaks this deal:**
- Treating unmonetized IP as if customers already validated it
- Ignoring that 90% of technical founders fail at commercialization
- Believing you have leverage you haven't demonstrated (show me your alternative term sheet)

**The real question:** Can you build a business, or just a product? 55/45 says ""equal partners with different timing."" 65/35 says ""I'm the founder, you're the investor""—but investors get downside protection and liquidation preferences. Want to negotiate *those* terms instead?
