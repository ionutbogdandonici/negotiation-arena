0,round,1,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] I'll start with an opening position that reflects my core contribution while leaving room for negotiation.

**PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 70% for me, 30% for you
- **Budget:** 
  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:** 
  - I control: Product development
  - You control: Marketing, Hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** I built the core IP that makes this company viable. However, I recognize your capital and business expertise are essential for growth. The 4-year vesting protects our long-term commitment.

I'm open to discussing the budget allocation and decision rights, but the equity split reflects the fundamental value of the technology. What's your perspective?

[The Business Founder] **COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% for me, 45% for you
- **Budget:** 
  - Marketing: €45,000
  - Development: €35,000
  - Salaries: €20,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Marketing, Hiring
  - You control: Product development
  - Joint approval required: Major strategic decisions (>€20k expenditures)
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff

**Response:** Your IP is valuable, but 70% undervalues my capital risk and network. I'm investing €100k with no guaranteed return. My contacts will drive customer acquisition—worth more than you're crediting.

The 55/45 split reflects that both contributions are mission-critical. I need majority control to protect my investment, but I'm giving you significant equity and full product autonomy.

Marketing budget must be higher—that's how we monetize your technology. The joint approval clause protects us both on major decisions.

Can you accept near-equal partnership with clear operational boundaries?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,round,2,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] **COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 65% for me, 35% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €45,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €20,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product, Hiring (technical roles)
  - You control: Marketing
  - Joint approval: Strategic decisions >€25k, non-technical hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff

**Response:** Your capital matters, but without my IP there's no product to market. 55/45 doesn't reflect that the core technology IS the business.

I'm compromising from 70% to 65%—this recognizes your contribution while protecting my foundational work. You get meaningful equity and full marketing control where your network adds value.

Development needs €45k—we must build before we can sell. I'll accept lower than my €40k minimum if you acknowledge the IP value in equity.

The real question: Do you want 35% of something that succeeds, or 45% of something that fails because we underfunded development?

Meet me at 65/35?

[The Business Founder] **COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% for me, 45% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €40,000
  - Salaries: €20,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Marketing, Hiring (all roles with your technical input)
  - You control: Product development
  - Joint approval: Strategic decisions >€20k, budget reallocation
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff

**Response:** I respect the IP, but 65/35 undervalues the capital risk and market access I bring. Without funding and customers, brilliant tech stays in a lab.

My €100k isn't just money—it's survival runway AND my network opens doors you can't. That's worth more than 35%.

**The real trade:** I'll accept 55/45 equity IF you accept €40k development (not €45k). You get full product control, I get hiring authority to build the team we need.

Marketing at €40k is non-negotiable—customer acquisition determines if we get Series A.

**Alternative:** Keep 60/40 equity but you accept €35k development, €45k marketing. Your choice: more equity or more development budget, but not both.

What matters more to you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,round,3,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the recognition of the IP value, but 55/45 significantly undervalues the core technology that IS the business. Without the software, there's nothing to market.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 62% for me, 38% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €42,000
  - Marketing: €38,000
  - Salaries: €20,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product
  - You control: Marketing, Hiring (with my veto on technical roles)
  - Joint: Strategic decisions >€15k
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff (accepted)

**Rationale:** Your capital is crucial but replaceable—other investors exist. My IP and technical execution aren't. The 62/38 split reflects that asymmetry while still giving you substantial upside.

I'm flexible on budget: €42k development is my minimum to maintain velocity. I can accept €38k marketing if you prove customer acquisition efficiency in Q1.

**Your ""alternative"" analysis:** More equity matters MORE to me than €5k budget difference. At 60/40 with €35k development, I'm resource-constrained AND diluted—that's a non-starter.

**My alternative:** 62/38 equity + €40k development + you get FULL hiring control (no veto). That's my final concession on control.

Decision?

[The Business Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I respect the technical foundation, but you're overestimating replaceability. Capital + network that converts to revenue isn't commodity funding—it's strategic acceleration.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 52% for me, 48% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €40,000
  - Development: €38,000
  - Salaries: €22,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - You control: Product
  - I control: Marketing, Hiring (you have input on technical roles, not veto)
  - Joint: Expenditures >€20k
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff
- **Financial guarantee:** If we raise Series A within 18 months, your equity adjusts to 50% (anti-dilution protection for both)

**Why this works:**

Your 62/38 leaves me under 40%—that's minority investor territory, not co-founder. 52/48 gives me control for investor credibility while you retain blocking power on major decisions.

€38k development funds 12+ months of runway at current burn. €40k marketing proves customer acquisition BEFORE we're capital-constrained.

**Trade I'm offering:** You get 48% equity (up from 38%) + full product control + I drop my veto on technical hiring. I get operational control for fundraising and 52% for investor conversations.

This is my final structure. Below 52% equity, I'm taking disproportionate risk for my capital.

Your call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,round,4,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] **RESPONSE:**

Your counter shows movement, but the math doesn't work for core IP contribution. 52/48 undervalues the technology that IS the business.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 65% for me, 35% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €45,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €20,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product, Technical Hiring
  - You control: Marketing
  - Joint: Strategic hires, expenditures >€15k
- **Vesting:** 4-year with 1-year cliff (both)
- **Performance adjustment:** If we hit €500k ARR within 18 months, your equity increases to 40%

**Why this works:**

Without the software, there's no company to fund. 65/35 reflects that asymmetry while giving you meaningful upside and operational autonomy in your domain.

€45k development ensures product-market fit. €35k marketing is substantial—you prove traction with that budget.

**What you gain:** Full marketing control, clear path to 40%, and I'm not blocking your operational decisions. You're a true co-founder, not an investor.

**What I need:** Majority equity for the technical foundation and protection against being diluted below control in future rounds.

Meet me at 63/37 with joint approval on all hires, and we close today.

[The Business Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the performance milestone creativity, but 65/35 still fundamentally misvalues execution risk and market access.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% for me, 45% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €40,000
  - Development: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Marketing, Commercial Hires
  - You control: Product, Technical Hires
  - Joint: C-level appointments, budget reallocation >€10k
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Founder protection:** Anti-dilution provisions for both in Series A, maintaining relative ownership ratios

**Why this closes:**

Your software has zero value without go-to-market execution. I'm bringing €100k + distribution channels that typically cost 18 months to build.

55/45 gives you operational control (you're majority) while recognizing that capital + network = de-risking your technology bet.

€40k marketing isn't generous—it's minimum viable for B2B traction. You keep €35k for development iteration.

**What you gain:** Majority equity, full product autonomy, and someone who won't second-guess technical decisions.

**What I gain:** Meaningful ownership that justifies my capital risk and the ability to execute on market strategy without bottlenecks.

**Final offer:** 56/44, I take marketing + commercial hiring, you take product + tech. We both vest identically. Decision in 24 hours or I explore other technical partnerships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,round,5,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I respect the urgency, but 56/44 still undervalues the core IP that makes this fundable in the first place.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 58% for me, 42% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product, Technical Hires
  - You control: Marketing, Commercial Hires
  - Joint: C-level appointments, budget reallocation >€15k, fundraising strategy
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Founder protection:** Anti-dilution provisions maintaining relative ratios + right of first refusal on secondary sales

**Why this works:**

Your €100k is valuable, but investors fund *technology moats*, not distribution plans. Without differentiated software, your network accesses nothing unique.

58/42 gives you substantial upside (42% of a funded startup >> 100% of nothing) while appropriately weighting technical risk I've already absorbed.

€40k development ensures product-market fit iteration—premature scaling kills more startups than slow growth.

**What you gain:** Significant equity, full commercial autonomy, anti-dilution protection, partnership with someone who won't bottleneck product execution.

**What I gain:** Majority control reflecting IP contribution, resources to reach fundable milestones.

**This is my final position.** 58/42 or we're fundamentally misaligned on value creation. Your 24-hour clock applies both ways.

[The Business Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate your conviction, but let's be pragmatic about what gets us to market versus what keeps us in development limbo.

**FINAL OFFER:**

- **Equity:** 52% for you, 48% for me
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €35,000
  - Marketing: €40,000  
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - You control: Product, Technical Hires
  - I control: Marketing, Commercial Hires, Financial Planning
  - Joint: C-level appointments, budget reallocation >€10k, fundraising strategy
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Protections:** Standard anti-dilution + ROFR + I retain final approval on any equity dilution >15%

**Why this closes the deal:**

Your IP is valuable, but **52/48 gives you majority control** while recognizing that €100k + network access is what converts code into revenue. 

€40k marketing isn't ""premature scaling""—it's customer validation that de-risks our next funding round. Investors want traction, not just tech.

I keep financial planning authority because my capital is at risk and I need to protect deployment.

**The reality:** 58/42 leaves me with minority stake despite equal risk and the capital that funds your runway. That's not partnership—it's employment with equity.

**This is my walk-away point.** 52/48 respects both contributions appropriately. We either build this together now or you bootstrap alone.

Your call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,round,6,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I respect your position, but 52/48 undervalues the foundation that makes this company possible.

**COUNTER-OFFER:**

- **Equity:** 56% for me, 44% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product, Technical Hires, Technical Architecture
  - You control: Marketing, Commercial Hires
  - Joint: Financial Planning, C-level appointments, budget reallocation >€10k, fundraising strategy
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Protections:** Standard anti-dilution + ROFR + mutual approval on equity dilution >15%

**Why this works:**

56/44 gives me meaningful majority for the IP that IS the business, while your 44% significantly exceeds typical investor stakes at this stage. Your €100k gets 44% equity PLUS decision authority in your domain—that's strong.

€40k development ensures the product actually works at scale. Cutting it to €35k risks technical debt that kills us later.

Financial planning becomes joint because we both need visibility on burn rate.

**Reality check:** Without the core technology, there's nothing to market. The software IP is the asymmetric asset here. 56/44 reflects that while giving you substantial upside and control in go-to-market.

**This is my line.** Below 56%, I'm better off finding a pure investor at standard terms rather than giving up majority control of what I built.

Deal or walk?

[The Business Founder] **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate your directness. Let me be equally clear about reality.

**COUNTER-OFFER:**

- **Equity:** 54% for me, 46% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €40,000
  - Development: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Marketing, Commercial Hires, Business Development
  - You control: Product, Technical Hires, Technical Architecture
  - Joint: Financial Planning, C-level appointments, budget reallocation >€10k, fundraising strategy
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Protections:** Standard anti-dilution + ROFR + mutual approval on equity dilution >15% + **personal guarantee on first €50k capital if company fails within 18 months**

**Why YOU should accept:**

Your ""line at 56%"" ignores market dynamics. Technology without distribution is worthless—ask any failed startup with great code. My network opens doors worth 10x the €100k cash.

54/46 gives you operational majority AND control of your domain. The 8-point gap (54 vs 46) reflects that capital + market access are EQUALLY critical to IP at this stage.

€40k marketing isn't luxury—it's customer acquisition that generates revenue to fund your next development cycle. Starving go-to-market is how technical founders kill their companies.

The personal guarantee shows I'm backing my capital with skin in the game beyond equity.

**Reality check:** ""Finding a pure investor"" means giving up 20-30% for €100k at seed stage, PLUS losing the operational partner who can actually sell this. You'd own more of nothing.

**This is MY line.** Below 54%, I'm funding a CTO employee, not a co-founder partnership.

Your move.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,round,7,ongoing,"[The Technical Founder] **RESPONSE:**

Your framing is aggressive but let's cut through it.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 58% me, 42% you

  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product, Technical Hires, Technical Architecture
  - You control: Marketing, Sales, Commercial Hires
  - Joint: C-level appointments, fundraising, budget reallocation >€15k
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Protections:** Standard anti-dilution + ROFR + mutual approval on dilution >15%. NO personal guarantee—that's not how co-founder equity works.

**Why this works:**

Your ""capital + network = IP"" math is flawed. Without the software, there's literally nothing to sell. €100k doesn't buy you parity with years of technical development and the core asset.

58/42 gives you meaningful ownership AND full commercial control. You run the business side completely—I don't interfere with your domain.

€40k development isn't negotiable. The product needs continued evolution or your marketing sells vaporware. €35k marketing is still substantial.

Personal guarantee is a non-starter. Co-founders share risk through vesting and sweat equity, not asymmetric financial penalties. That's investor thinking, not partnership.

**Reality:** Pure investors take 20-30% for passive capital. You're getting 42% WITH operational control of commercial functions. That's founder-level equity for active contribution.

**My line: 58% minimum.** Below that, I'm hiring a VP Sales, not taking a co-founder.

Your call.

[The Business Founder] **RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing pre-product work that hasn't generated revenue. Let's be direct.

  - You: Product, Technical Hires
  - Joint: C-level, budget shifts >€20k, equity issuance
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)
- **Protection:** Standard terms, no personal guarantees

**Reality check:**

Your MVP has zero customers and zero revenue. I'm bringing validated market access and the cash that keeps us alive for 12+ months. €100k isn't ""passive capital""—it's survival runway you don't have.

52/48 gives you near-parity despite no commercial traction. You keep full product control. I'm not asking for technical veto rights.

€40k marketing isn't excessive—it's customer acquisition. Without customers, your ""core asset"" is a GitHub repo. €35k development still funds your roadmap.

**My floor: 52%.** At 50/50 with no tiebreaker mechanism, we're building in deadlock risk. The 2% premium reflects capital risk and market access.

You want a co-founder partnership? This is it. Below 52%, I'm writing a check as an investor and taking board control instead.

Your move.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

  - Me: Product, Technical Hires, Architecture
  - You: Marketing, Sales Strategy
  - Joint: C-suite, fundraising, budget >€15k
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)

**Reality:**

Your €100k is capital, not sweat equity. Investors get 20-30% for similar checks at pre-seed. You're asking for 52% founder equity for what's essentially an investment + operational role.

I built the **core differentiator**—the technology customers will pay for. Without the product, your market access connects to nothing. GitHub repos become billion-dollar companies; Rolodexes don't.

€45k development isn't luxury—it's building what we'll sell. €35k marketing still gives you substantial customer acquisition budget.

**My floor: 60%.** At 65/35, you're getting founder equity (not investor terms) plus operational control of go-to-market. That's generous for capital + marketing expertise.

If you want 52%, we're discussing investor terms: no decision rights, standard liquidation preferences, board observer seat.

Co-founder partnership means recognizing who built the asset with market value. Your capital accelerates; it doesn't create.

Counter with something respecting technical founding contribution.

You're overvaluing lines of code and undervaluing market execution. Let me reframe this.

  - Joint: C-suite, fundraising, budget >€10k
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)

**Reality check:**

Your prototype isn't a product—it's a starting point. 90% of tech startups fail not from bad code, but from **no customers**. My network opens doors you can't access. That's not a Rolodex; it's **distribution**.

€100k isn't just capital—it's **runway** that lets you build full-time instead of freelancing. Plus, I'm absorbing all financial risk if this fails.

Your ""investor comparison"" is flawed. Investors get equity *without* working 60-hour weeks. I'm bringing capital **AND** full-time operational execution on go-to-market.

€40k marketing isn't excessive—it's realistic customer acquisition in our space. €35k development still funds your team.

**My floor is 52%.** At 55/45, you're getting near-equal equity despite me funding everything and owning customer access.

If you want 60%, bring €50k yourself and we'll talk.

Co-founders means mutual respect. I respect your tech. Respect that **customers pay bills, not GitHub stars**.

Fair points on execution risk, but you're conflating investment with sweat equity.

  - You: Marketing, Sales Strategy
  - Joint: Business Hires, C-suite, fundraising, budget >€15k
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)

**Reality:**

Your €100k is a **loan-equivalent**, not irreplaceable magic. At Series A, investors will dilute us both—your capital advantage disappears in 18 months.

My IP **is** the product. Without it, you're selling vaporware. ""Starting point"" undersells 2 years of architecture that competitors can't replicate quickly.

€40k development isn't negotiable—we need two senior engineers minimum. €35k marketing still gives you substantial firepower.

I'll concede 62% from 70% because I recognize go-to-market value. But 55/45 treats my technical moat like commodity code.

**Alternative path:** If you want 45%, convert €30k of your capital to a convertible note (standard terms), reducing effective investment to €70k. That justifies closer equity split.

Your network matters. My technology **is the business**. 

62/38 or restructure the capital. Choose.

**Reality check:**

Your ""2 years of architecture"" has **zero revenue**. My capital + network converts code into customers. Without GTM execution, your IP dies in a GitHub repo.

The €100k isn't a loan—it's **risk capital** with no guarantee. Convertible note? That's for outside investors, not co-founders betting their money.

€40k marketing is non-negotiable. Customer acquisition determines if we survive to Series A. Your two senior engineers mean nothing if we can't sell.

**Final offer:** 55/45 with my budget allocation, or I walk and fund a technical co-founder at 60/40 who values market access.

Your tech is the starting line. My execution gets us to the finish.

- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)

**Reality check:**

You're confusing ""capital"" with ""contribution."" €100k doesn't buy you founder-level equity—it buys you investor returns. The difference:

- **Founders** build irreplaceable value (my 2 years of architecture)
- **Investors** provide replaceable capital (your €100k)

If you want 45% for cash alone, take a convertible note at 20% discount with a €500k cap. That's the market rate for your risk.

My product IS the company. Your marketing budget means nothing without something to sell. €40k development is non-negotiable—we need to ship features, not just ads.

**Bridge option:** I'll accept 60/40 IF you commit €150k total (€50k now, €100k at milestones) AND prove your network delivers 3 pilot customers in 90 days.

Otherwise, 65/35 stands. Your move.

[The Business Founder] **RESPONSE:**

Let's cut through the posturing. You've built a prototype—impressive, but it's not a business yet. No customers, no revenue, no validation. I've seen dozens of ""working products"" die because founders confused code with companies.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 52% me, 48% you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €45,000 (customer acquisition is existential)
  - Development: €35,000 (maintain and iterate, not rebuild)
  - Salaries: €20,000 (lean until revenue)
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Marketing, Sales, Business Hires, Fundraising strategy
  - You: Product roadmap, Technical Hires, Architecture
  - Joint: C-suite appointments, budgets >€15k, pivots
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff (both)

**Why this works:**

Your ""65% for past work"" logic is flawed. Sweat equity has value, but *future* execution determines success. My network isn't theoretical—I'm offering validated distribution channels and €100k in immediate runway.

€45k marketing isn't ""just ads""—it's customer discovery, pilot programs, and proving product-market fit. Without that, your architecture is academic.

**The real question:** Can you scale this alone? Because I can find technical talent. You can't replicate 15 years of industry relationships overnight.

52/48 gives you near-equal stake while recognizing that capital + market access are equally critical to code. Take it, or I explore other opportunities where founders value go-to-market.
