Business Founder countered aggressively but signaled flexibility on equity for control retention. Both parties demonstrate cooperativeness through explicit openness to negotiation. Low ambiguity due to structured proposals. Fairness concerns arise from competing valuation of technical IP versus capital contribution.,"The Technical Founder: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our equity structure and operational framework. Given that I've developed the core software that forms the foundation of our business, I believe my technical contribution warrants significant recognition.

**PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 65% for me, 35% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 for development, EUR 35,000 for marketing, EUR 25,000 for salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product; you control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** The software IP is our primary asset. I'm proposing you lead marketing and hiring since you bring operational expertise and capital. The 4-year vesting protects our long-term commitment. I've allocated substantial budget to marketing to leverage your strengths, while ensuring adequate development resources.

I'm open to discussing adjustments, particularly around budget allocation and decision rights. What's your perspective on this framework?
The Business Founder: I respect your technical contribution, but your proposal significantly undervalues the capital and network I'm bringing. Without my €100k and connections, the software remains uncommercialised.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% for me, 45% for you
- Budget: EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 25,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Marketing and Hiring; you control Product
- Vesting: 4-year schedule with 1-year cliff

**Rationale:** My capital enables this venture. The 55-45 split reflects both our contributions while giving me operational control through marketing and hiring decisions. I've increased marketing budget substantially - this is where we'll generate revenue. The cliff protects against early departure.

I'm flexible on moving toward 50-50 equity **if** I retain final say on strategic hires and marketing direction. The decision rights matter more to me than the 5% equity difference.

What's negotiable for you - equity percentage or control areas?"

Business Founder presented final options (50-50 or 52-48) awaiting Technical Founder's response. Key gaps remain on hiring control and budget allocation despite convergence on equity and vesting terms.,Constructive negotiation with clear proposals and rationales. Both parties show flexibility on equity (converging toward 50-50) and agreed on vesting structure. Main sticking points are hiring authority and marketing versus development budget allocation. Business Founder dominates through capital position and ultimatum choices.,"The Technical Founder: I appreciate your directness. Let me be clear about what works and what doesn't.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 50% each
- Budget: EUR 35,000 salaries, EUR 25,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development  
- Decision rights: You control Marketing; I control Product and Hiring; we jointly approve C-level hires
- Vesting: 4-year schedule, 6-month cliff (not 1-year)

**My reasoning:** 

Your 55-45 split undervalues the IP that IS the business. However, I'll accept 50-50 if I control hiring - technical talent is critical and I know who we need. You get full marketing autonomy, which addresses your revenue concern.

Your marketing budget is inflated. EUR 45k on marketing before product-market fit is premature. We need EUR 40k in development to build what customers will actually pay for.

The 6-month cliff is reasonable protection without being punitive.

**Non-negotiable for me:** Minimum 50% equity and Product control. 

**Flexible on:** Budget allocation within reason, and I'm open to joint approval on senior hires if you accept this structure.

Does joint C-level hiring approval work for you?
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the movement toward equal equity, but your proposal creates operational gridlock and underfunds our market entry.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 52% me, 48% you
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 35k development
- Decision rights: You control Product; I control Marketing AND Hiring (with your veto on C-level); we co-approve budget over EUR 10k
- Vesting: 4-year, 6-month cliff accepted

**Why this works:**

The 52-48 reflects my capital risk and network value for customer acquisition. It's symbolic control, not dominance.

**Hiring must stay with me.** You'll hire engineers who optimize for elegance, not market speed. I'll find people who ship fast and iterate. You get C-level veto - that protects technical culture.

EUR 35k marketing is the *minimum* for B2B traction in 6 months. Cutting it to EUR 25k means we're still pitching slides at month 9 instead of showing revenue.

**My flexibility:** I'll accept 50-50 IF I keep Hiring authority (with your C-level veto). That's my final equity concession.

**Your call:** Take 50-50 with my hiring control, or 52-48 with joint hiring on senior roles only?"

Business Founder leverages capital contribution to demand 55-45 equity and hiring control. Technical Founder defends 50-50 with IP value and domain expertise arguments. Both show flexibility on budget and vesting but remain deadlocked on core power distribution.,"The Technical Founder: **RESPONSE:**

Your hiring concern is valid but misses the technical reality: poor early engineering hires create technical debt that kills startups. I've seen it repeatedly.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 50-50
- Budget: EUR 32k salaries, EUR 33k marketing, EUR 35k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + Engineering hiring (all levels); You control Marketing + Business hiring; Joint approval on C-level across functions
- Vesting: 4-year, 6-month cliff

**Why this is fair:**

50-50 equity with your capital recognized through **first-money-out rights**: if we exit below EUR 500k, you recover your EUR 50k investment before equity split applies.

**Hiring split by domain expertise:** You hire for market-facing roles where speed matters. I hire engineers where technical judgment prevents catastrophic mistakes. We both approve C-level together - that's the check-and-balance.

EUR 33k marketing funds your 6-month traction plan. EUR 35k development ensures we don't ship garbage that damages reputation.

**This protects both our interests:** You get capital protection + marketing control + business hiring. I get technical integrity + engineering team quality.

**Alternative if you reject 50-50:** 55% me, 45% you, with same decision split and no first-money-out provision.

Your move.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the first-money-out creative thinking, but let's be direct: I'm bringing €100k total capital plus the network that will make or break our first year. A €50k preference on sub-€500k exits doesn't reflect that asymmetry.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% me, 45% you
- Budget: EUR 35k salaries, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 25k development
- Decision rights: You control Product + technical hiring (non-C-level); I control Marketing + all business hiring + final say on C-level across all functions
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff for both

**Rationale:**

Your 50-50 assumes equal risk. I'm risking real capital; you're risking opportunity cost. The 55-45 split with my C-level approval rights balances this while giving you full technical autonomy day-to-day.

**Budget reflects go-to-market priority:** EUR 40k marketing funds aggressive customer acquisition—revenue validates everything else. EUR 25k development is sufficient for MVP with your technical efficiency.

**Hiring structure protects both:** You build your engineering team without interference. I ensure we don't over-hire or mis-hire at senior levels where burn rate matters most.

**The 1-year cliff protects the partnership:** If either of us isn't fully committed after 12 months, clean exit.

This gives you operational control where it matters (product, tech team) while protecting my capital risk with equity position and strategic oversight.

Accept 55-45 or propose a different equity number with your reasoning."
3,4,ongoing,6,"compromise, asymmetry",7,"movement, flexibility",4,"framing, positioning",8,"structured, substantive",3,"clear, specific",7,2,6,7,adaptive,The Business Founder,Capital leverage and persistent reframing of value contribution to maintain equity advantage,Technical Founder could anchor more effectively on IP valuation early; Business Founder could propose creative structures beyond equity percentage,"Negotiation remains ongoing because parties are converging on structure (decision rights, vesting, budget) but remain 14 percentage points apart on equity (57-43 vs 65-35), with neither willing to concede their valuation framework","High-quality negotiation with clear proposals and rationales. Both parties show adaptive strategy and genuine concessions. Business Founder maintains slight dominance through capital framing. Gap persists on equity valuation: IP versus capital contribution. Low ambiguity, moderate fairness perception due to unresolved core issue.","The Technical Founder: **RESPONSE:**

I respect your capital contribution, but let's address the fundamental value asymmetry: without the core software IP I've built, there's no company to fund. Your €100k buys acceleration, not the foundation.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 65% me, 35% you
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 30k marketing, EUR 40k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + all technical hiring; You control Marketing + business hiring (non-technical); **Joint approval required for C-level hires**
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff for both

**Rationale:**

**Equity reality check:** Pre-money valuation implicitly values my IP. Standard founder equity for technical founders with working product is 60-70%. Your 55-45 undervalues proven technology vs. deployable capital.

**Budget rebalance:** EUR 40k development isn't luxury—it's maintaining competitive advantage and scaling what already works. EUR 30k marketing still funds solid customer acquisition without over-indexing on unproven channels.

**C-level joint approval:** Your ""final say on all C-level"" creates asymmetric power. Joint approval protects both our interests and prevents unilateral strategic shifts.

**The trade:** I'm moving from my target 70% to 65%, acknowledging your capital risk. But 55-45 treats software IP as commodity—it's not.

**Alternative path if 65-35 doesn't work:** Keep 60-40 equity BUT I retain board control (2 seats me, 1 seat you) to protect product vision. Your call.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the IP value, but let's be clear: working code without market execution, capital runway, and customer acquisition is a science project, not a business. My network opens doors your GitHub commits can't.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 57% you, 43% me
- Budget: EUR 35k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 30k development
- Decision rights: You control Product + technical hiring; I control Marketing + business hiring; **Joint approval for C-level AND any hire >EUR 80k**
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties

**My reasoning:**

**Equity movement:** I'm moving from 45% to 43%, meeting you closer to middle ground. 57-43 reflects that while your IP is foundational, my capital is existential—no runway means no company in 3 months.

**Budget compromise:** EUR 35k marketing isn't negotiable—customer acquisition determines survival. EUR 30k development still funds your technical needs while acknowledging we need paying customers, not perfect code.

**Hiring threshold:** Joint approval on >EUR 80k hires protects both our capital efficiency concerns, not just C-level theatrics.

**What I need clarity on:** Your ""board control"" alternative is a non-starter—2:1 board seats with minority equity creates misaligned governance. If you want control insurance, let's discuss **protective provisions** (I can't be diluted below 35% without consent, major strategic pivots require supermajority).

**Bottom line:** 57-43 + protective provisions, or we're stuck. Your technical vision needs my commercial execution—let's structure this as partners, not adversaries."

Technical Founder anchored at 65% valuing IP; Business Founder anchored at 55% valuing capital and execution. Both made incremental concessions on budget and governance but remained entrenched on equity split, resulting in explicit deadlock.","The Technical Founder: **RESPONSE:**

Your market access matters, but let's address the fundamental asymmetry: without the core technology, there's nothing to sell. Your network opens doors to empty rooms if the product doesn't exist.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 65% me, 35% you
- Budget: EUR 40k development, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 25k salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product + Development + technical hiring; You control Marketing + sales hiring; **Joint approval for C-level only**
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties
- **Protective provision accepted:** You cannot be diluted below 30% without consent

**My reasoning:**

**Equity:** Moving from 70% to 65% acknowledges your capital and network value, but 57-43 undervalues the IP that IS the business. The technology took 18 months to build and represents the entire competitive moat. Your contribution, while valuable, is replaceable—my IP isn't.

**Budget reallocation:** EUR 40k development is non-negotiable. We need to complete the product roadmap for enterprise clients. EUR 35k marketing is generous given we're pre-product-market-fit. Cutting salaries to EUR 25k creates urgency for both of us.

**Hiring control:** Joint approval on >EUR 80k is operational micromanagement. C-level joint approval protects strategic alignment without paralyzing execution. Day-to-day hires should follow domain expertise.

**Your protective provision:** Accepted at 30% floor. This addresses your dilution concern without distorting current equity reality.

**What I need from you:** Commitment that marketing spend focuses on validation, not vanity metrics. EUR 35k buys us customer discovery, not billboard campaigns.

**Bottom line:** 65-35 reflects contribution reality. I'm offering you significant upside on capital that could be raised elsewhere. Let's close this.
The Business Founder: **RESPONSE:**

You're overplaying the ""irreplaceable IP"" card. Technology without market access is a science project, not a business. I've seen brilliant tech die in garages while inferior products with strong distribution dominate markets. Your 18 months of development has zero value until customers pay for it.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% you, 45% me
- Budget: EUR 35k development, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 25k salaries
- Decision rights: You control Product + Development; I control Marketing + **Hiring (all)**; **Joint approval for budget >EUR 15k and all C-level**
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both parties
- Protective provision: Neither party diluted below 35% without consent

**My reasoning:**

**Equity:** 55-45 is my final position. You're conflating ""built the tech"" with ""owns the entire business value."" I'm bringing EUR 100k cash (eliminating dilutive seed round), a network that cuts 12-18 months off customer acquisition, and operational experience you lack. Your alternative is raising external capital at 20-30% dilution plus losing control to investors. I'm offering you majority equity AND control—that's generous.

**Budget:** EUR 40k marketing is minimum viable. We need customer validation BEFORE over-investing in development. EUR 35k development funds your roadmap completion—you don't need more until we have paying customers proving the thesis. This isn't vanity metrics; it's survival.

**Hiring control:** I need full hiring authority. You'll hire developers who optimize for elegance over shipping. I'll hire for speed and customer impact. C-level joint approval protects us both. EUR 15k budget threshold prevents unilateral big bets.

**Protective provision:** 35% floor for both parties. Fair symmetry.

**What I need from you:** Stop treating this like you're licensing IP to me. We're building a company together. Your tech is table stakes; my execution capability and capital determine if we succeed or become another ""great technology, no business"" cautionary tale.

**Take it or we're deadlocked.** 55-45 reflects reality: neither of us succeeds alone."
