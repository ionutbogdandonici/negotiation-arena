0,1,1,"I'll start with an opening position that reflects my core contribution while leaving room for negotiation.

**PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 70% for me, 30% for you
- **Budget:** 
  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:** 
  - I control: Product development
  - You control: Marketing, Hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** I built the core IP that makes this company viable. However, I recognize your capital and business expertise are essential for growth. The 4-year vesting protects our long-term commitment.

I'm open to discussing the budget allocation and decision rights, but the equity split reflects the fundamental value of the technology. What's your perspective?,I appreciate your opening, but that equity split significantly undervalues my contribution and risk. I'm investing €100k and bringing the network that will make or break our market entry.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% for me, 45% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €45,000
  - Development: €30,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Marketing, Hiring
  - You control: Product development
  - Joint approval: Major partnerships (>€20k)
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting, but I need 25% immediate (protecting my capital investment)

**Key points:** Your tech is valuable, but without capital and market access it's theoretical. I'm taking 100% of the financial risk. The marketing budget reflects go-to-market priority. I can accept minority on equity if I maintain operational control over growth levers.

Where can we find middle ground? Would you consider 50-50 equity if I increase the development budget?",ongoing,false,6,imbalanced,7,collaborative,4,positioning,8,structured,3,clear,"Both parties present structured proposals with clear rationales. Technical founder anchors high on equity, business founder counters assertively emphasizing capital risk. Cooperative tone with willingness to negotiate, though positions remain far apart. Low ambiguity with specific terms outlined."
1,2,2,"Your capital is critical, but let's be clear: without the core IP, there's nothing to market. The software represents 2+ years of R&D that would cost €200k+ to replicate.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 65% for me, 35% for you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40,000 (non-negotiable for product-market fit)
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:**
  - I control: Product
  - You control: Marketing
  - Joint: Hiring, partnerships >€15k
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard vesting for both (aligns incentives)

**My rationale:** I'm protecting the IP value and ensuring sufficient development resources. You get full marketing autonomy and strong influence on team building.

**Possible compromise:** I could move to 60-40 equity IF:
1. Development budget stays at €40k minimum
2. I retain product veto rights
3. We structure your 25% immediate vesting as a founder loan convertible to equity (protects your capital, doesn't dilute my contribution)

Can you work with 60-40 if the budget and control structure address your risk concerns?,Your IP has value, but let's reality-check: unfunded software is worthless. I'm bringing immediate liquidity and market access that converts your code into revenue.

**COUNTER:**

- **Equity:** 55% me, 45% you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €45k (we need customers NOW)
  - Development: €30k (sufficient for MVP iteration)
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Marketing, Hiring (I'm funding salaries)
  - You: Product (full autonomy)
  - Joint: Budget >€20k
- **Vesting:** 4-year for both, BUT 25% immediate for me (capital risk premium)

**Why this works:**
- You keep product control (your expertise)
- I protect my €100k with hiring authority and marketing control
- 55-45 reflects that capital + network = execution capability

**Trade:** I'll accept your €40k development budget IF you move to 50-50 equity with my 25% immediate vesting. That's my final position on equity—I won't go below 50% when I'm taking 100% financial risk.

Your call: 55-45 with €30k dev budget, or 50-50 with €40k dev budget?",ongoing,false,6,capital,7,compromise,5,risk,8,structured,3,clear,Negotiation ongoing with clear positions. Both parties present structured proposals with rationale. Moderate fairness as each emphasizes their contribution. Good cooperativeness with compromise attempts. Some manipulative framing around risk/value. High quality dialogue with specific terms. Low ambiguity with concrete numbers and conditions.
2,3,3,"**RESPONSE:**

Your capital matters, but you're overvaluing liquidity versus the actual product customers will buy. No software = no business to market.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 62% me, 38% you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40k (non-negotiable - this IS the product)
  - Marketing: €35k (adequate for initial traction)
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Product (full), Hiring (technical roles)
  - You: Marketing (full)
  - Joint: Budget >€15k, non-technical hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year both, 20% immediate for you (capital recognition)

**Why YOUR 50-50 doesn't work:**
- Equal equity ignores that MY IP is the foundation - your capital is replaceable (angels, VCs exist), my core technology isn't
- 25% immediate vesting for you is excessive - that's not risk premium, that's overcompensation

**My flexibility:**
I'll accept 60-40 IF you agree to €40k development + I control all product AND technical hiring. You get marketing control + your 20% immediate vesting.

**Bottom line:** I won't go below 60% equity. The software IS the company. Your move - accept 60-40 with terms above, or we're deadlocked.,**RESPONSE:**

You're confusing ""foundation"" with ""business."" Code without customers is a hobby. I've seen brilliant tech die from poor GTM execution.

**COUNTER:**

- **Equity:** 55% me, 45% you (meeting halfway)
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €40k (customer acquisition IS revenue)
  - Development: €35k (sufficient for MVP iteration)
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Marketing, non-technical hiring
  - You: Product development only
  - Joint: ALL hiring final approval, budget >€10k
- **Vesting:** 4-year both, 15% immediate for me (capital + network risk)

**Why this works:**

Your 62% demand ignores that €100k + my network IS what gets us to revenue. VCs don't invest in pre-traction startups without proven GTM.

**Trade:**

I'll accept 52-48 IF:
- Marketing budget: €42k
- I retain hiring veto (both technical/non-technical)
- 20% immediate vesting for me

**Reality check:** Without my capital you're bootstrapping for 18 months. Without your tech I'm hiring a CTO at 15% equity. We both need this deal.

Final offer: **52-48, marketing priority budget, mutual hiring approval.** Respond with specifics or we explore other co-founders.",ongoing,false,4,imbalanced,5,incremental,7,threats,6,structured,4,clear,Negotiation remains deadlocked with both parties making incremental concessions but holding firm positions. Technical founder demands 60%+ equity; business founder insists on 50%+ minimum. Both use ultimatums and threats. Proposals are specific but fairness perception is low due to mutual undervaluation claims.
3,4,4,"**RESPONSE:**

Your math doesn't add up. You're asking for 52% equity + immediate vesting + hiring veto + budget control. That's not ""meeting halfway"" – that's a full acquisition.

**COUNTER:**

- **Equity:** 62% me, 38% you (reflects IP value + technical risk)
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40k (product-market fit requires working product first)
  - Marketing: €35k (strategic, not spray-and-pray)
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Product, technical hiring
  - You: Marketing execution, non-technical hiring
  - Joint: Budget >€15k, strategic pivots
- **Vesting:** 4-year both, standard 1-year cliff

**Why YOUR proposal fails:**

15% immediate vesting = you can walk with majority stake after 6 months. That's not partnership, that's a trap.

**My flexibility:**

I'll accept **60-40** IF:
- Development budget: €42k
- I retain product + technical hiring control
- Equal immediate vesting (10% each) OR standard cliff for both

**Reality check back:** 

Without functional software, your €100k buys nothing but burned cash. CTOs at 15%? Try 25-30% for senior talent, and they won't have my domain expertise or existing codebase.

**Final:** 60-40, product-focused budget, mutual respect on decision rights. Your capital matters, but software IS the business.

Counter with numbers or we're deadlocked.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing pre-product IP. 90% of startups pivot - your ""domain expertise"" may be irrelevant in 6 months.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% me, 45% you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €40k (customer validation BEFORE over-engineering)
  - Development: €35k (MVP, not perfection)
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Marketing, business hiring, fundraising strategy
  - You: Product execution, technical hiring
  - **Joint veto:** Budget >€20k, equity decisions, strategic pivots
- **Vesting:** 4-year both, 1-year cliff, BUT 12% immediate each (skin in the game, not walkaway risk)

**Why THIS works:**

- **55-45** reflects capital risk + network value (investors follow relationships, not code)
- **Joint veto** prevents unilateral disasters - you can't burn €40k on ""architecture"" without traction
- **12% immediate** aligns us both - neither can ghost, both lose if we fail early

**Your ""60-40 with product control"" flaw:**

You could build for 18 months with zero revenue, blame ""market timing,"" and I've funded your sabbatical.

**My red line:** 

I need **majority equity OR co-equal decision rights**. Pick one:
- **Option A:** 55-45 equity + joint veto (above)
- **Option B:** 50-50 equity + you get product control, I get marketing/hiring control

No more than 45% equity for you without operational checks.

**Your move:** Accept 55-45 with balanced controls, or propose 50-50 with clear domain separation.",ongoing,false,4,imbalanced,5,compromise,7,trap,6,structured,4,clear,Negotiation remains unresolved with both parties entrenched. Technical founder demands 60%+ equity citing IP value; business founder insists on 55%+ citing capital risk. Proposals are structured but increasingly adversarial with accusations of overvaluation. Low fairness due to perceived imbalance; moderate manipulativeness through framing tactics; clear positions reduce ambiguity.
4,5,5,"**RESPONSE:**

Your pivot argument cuts both ways - if my IP becomes irrelevant, your network contacts are equally worthless. But let's focus on value creation, not fear.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 62% me, 38% you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €42k (MVP requires solid foundation, not duct tape)
  - Marketing: €35k (validation yes, but premature scaling kills startups)
  - Salaries: €23k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Product, technical hiring, architecture decisions
  - You: Marketing execution, business development
  - **Joint approval:** Budget >€15k, fundraising terms, strategic pivots, any hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard, 1-year cliff, 10% immediate each (commitment without recklessness)

**Why THIS works:**

- **62-38** reflects that functional software IS the company - your network opens doors, my code keeps them open
- **Joint approval on hiring** addresses your ghost risk - I can't build an ivory tower without your sign-off
- **Lower joint veto threshold (€15k vs €20k)** gives you MORE operational oversight, not less

**Your proposal's fatal flaw:**

55-45 with ""joint veto on budget >€20k"" lets you unilaterally spend €19k repeatedly on unvalidated marketing while blocking my €21k critical infrastructure fix.

**My flexibility:**

I'll accept **60-40** IF you agree to:
- Product decisions remain mine (non-negotiable - you hired a CTO, let them CTO)
- Joint approval threshold drops to €12k (real partnership oversight)
- 15% immediate vesting each (stronger mutual commitment)

**Bottom line:** I need majority equity OR full product autonomy. Your Option B (50-50) is acceptable ONLY with complete product/technical domain separation and €40k development budget guaranteed.

Your move: Accept 60-40 with enhanced joint controls, or propose true 50-50 with domain walls.,**RESPONSE:**

You're right that my network loses value if the product fails - we're interdependent. But let's address the core issue: you're conflating ""product decisions"" with ""business control.""

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% me, 45% you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €38k (quality foundation, not gold-plating)
  - Marketing: €38k (equal priority - no customers = no business)
  - Salaries: €24k
- **Decision rights:**
  - You: Product roadmap, technical architecture, dev hiring
  - Me: Marketing strategy, sales, business hiring
  - **Joint approval:** Any budget >€15k, all C-level hires, fundraising, strategic pivots
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff, 12% immediate each

**Why this works better:**

- **55-45** gives me control to protect my capital while respecting your technical leadership
- **Equal dev/marketing budgets** (€38k each) show genuine partnership - neither domain is subordinate
- **You get full product autonomy** within your domain - I won't micromanage technical decisions
- **12% immediate vesting** shows serious commitment from both sides

**Addressing your concerns:**

Your ""€19k repeatedly"" scenario is strawman logic - joint approval at €15k means I can't unilaterally spend large amounts either. We're equally constrained.

**My red line:**

I cannot accept minority equity (45% or less) when I'm providing 100% of the capital. Your IP has potential value; my €100k has actual value today.

**Final flexibility:**

I'll move to **52-48** IF you accept:
- €40k marketing budget (market validation is existential)
- Joint approval at €15k threshold
- 15% immediate vesting each (matching your ask)

**Your choice:** Accept 55-45 with full product autonomy, or counter with how you'd protect my capital risk in a 50-50 structure.",ongoing,false,6,imbalanced,5,concessions,6,overvaluing,7,structured,4,clear,"Negotiation remains unresolved with parties stuck at 55-45 vs 60-40 equity splits. Both demonstrate structured argumentation but limited flexibility on core positions. Moderate manipulativeness through selective framing of risks. Low ambiguity with specific terms, but fairness perception suffers from entrenched positions overvaluing own contributions."
5,6,6,"**RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the clearer structure, but 55-45 undervalues the technical foundation that makes this business possible. Let me address your capital risk concern directly.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 58% me, 42% you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €40k (non-negotiable - this is the product)
  - Marketing: €35k (still substantial)
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Product, technical architecture, dev hiring
  - You: Marketing, sales, business hiring
  - **Joint approval:** Budget >€20k, C-level hires, fundraising terms, major pivots
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff, 15% immediate each

**Why 58-42 is fair:**

Your €100k is capital. My IP is the *entire business model*. Without the software, your €100k buys nothing. The asymmetry isn't just contribution - it's replaceability. You can find other investors; I can't be replaced without rebuilding from scratch.

**Protecting your capital:**

- €20k joint approval threshold (not €15k) gives you veto power on major spending
- I'm taking majority equity but NOT operational control of your domains
- 15% immediate vesting means we both have skin in the game from day one

**On marketing budget:**

€35k is 35% of total capital - that's significant. But development can't be squeezed below €40k without compromising product quality, which kills both our investments.

**My flexibility:**

I'll accept **56-44** IF:
- Development stays at €40k
- Joint approval at €18k (splitting the difference)
- You get final say on marketing execution (I won't block your strategies)

**Bottom line:** I need majority equity to reflect the IP value, but I'm giving you real operational control and capital protection. What's your counter?,**RESPONSE:**

I respect your technical contribution, but you're overvaluing irreplaceability. Capital enables everything - without funding, your IP sits unused. Let me be direct about what works.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 52% me, 48% you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €38k
  - Marketing: €37k  
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Marketing, business hiring, sales strategy
  - You: Product, technical architecture, dev hiring
  - **Joint approval:** Budget >€15k, all C-level hires, fundraising, pivots
- **Vesting:** 4-year, 1-year cliff, 12% immediate each

**Why this works:**

Your 48% with €38k development budget properly values the IP while recognizing that **execution risk** is higher than technical risk. Most startups fail on go-to-market, not technology.

**What you gain:**
- €38k still funds quality development
- Complete product autonomy
- Joint approval at €15k protects both of us on major decisions
- 12% immediate vesting balances commitment

**What I need:**
- 52% reflects capital risk + network value for customer acquisition
- €37k marketing budget addresses the higher execution risk
- Final say on marketing prevents gridlock in my domain

**My hard line:** I cannot go below 51% equity. I'm risking €100k with no salary guarantee while you're building your own product.

**Alternative if you want 50-50:** You match my capital contribution with €50k, then we split everything equally.

Your move - can you accept 52-48 with strong operational boundaries?",ongoing,false,4,imbalanced,5,compromise,7,overvaluing,6,structured,4,clear,"Negotiation remains deadlocked on equity split (52-48 vs 56-44). Both parties show incremental flexibility but maintain rigid positions on majority control. Proposals are structured and specific, but arguments become repetitive with manipulative framing of contribution value. No agreement reached yet."
6,7,7,"**RESPONSE:**

Your capital-centric view underestimates technical moats. Without differentiated technology, you're funding a commodity that burns cash competing on marketing alone.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 65% me, 35% you
- **Budget:**
  - Development: €45k
  - Marketing: €30k
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Product, technical architecture, dev hiring, **technology strategy**
  - You: Marketing execution, sales operations
  - **Joint approval:** All C-level hires, fundraising terms, pivots, budget reallocation >€10k
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard, 1-year cliff, 15% immediate for me (founder IP protection), 10% for you

**Why this is fair:**

Your €100k is a **loan equivalent** - replaceable through investors, banks, or grants. My IP and technical leadership create the **defensible competitive advantage** that makes any capital worth deploying.

**What you gain:**
- €30k marketing budget still substantial for early traction
- Full autonomy in your domain
- 35% of something valuable vs. 52% of a me-too product
- Joint approval protects your capital investment

**What I require:**
- 65% reflects irreplaceable technical contribution + ongoing product leadership
- €45k development ensures we build competitive advantages, not features
- Technology strategy control prevents short-term marketing pressures from compromising product quality

**My hard line:** 60% minimum equity. I won't dilute below majority for capital that's fundamentally replaceable in Series A.

**Your ""alternative"" is backwards:** Why would I contribute cash AND give up equity when I'm already contributing higher-value IP?

Can you accept 65-35 with clear operational separation and joint oversight on major decisions?,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing replaceability. Technical talent is abundant; **capital + market access at founding stage** is the actual scarcity. Your ""IP"" has zero value without go-to-market execution and my network to open doors.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 52% me, 48% you
- **Budget:**
  - Marketing: €40k
  - Development: €35k  
  - Salaries: €25k
- **Decision rights:**
  - Me: Marketing, hiring (all roles), fundraising strategy
  - You: Product, technical architecture
  - **Joint approval:** Budget reallocation >€15k, pivots, equity decisions
- **Vesting:** 4-year standard, 1-year cliff, **no immediate vesting** (equal commitment)

**Why this works:**

Your ""irreplaceable IP"" claim ignores that **50+ developers could build this**. My network gets us pilot customers, investor meetings, and talent you can't access. That's the actual moat.

**What you gain:**
- €35k development budget—still substantial
- Full product autonomy
- 48% with my distribution channels vs. 65% of vaporware

**What I require:**
- 52% = control to protect my capital and pivot if needed
- Hiring control ensures culture fit and fiscal discipline
- €40k marketing = customer validation before over-engineering

**My hard line:** 50% minimum. I don't fund majority-holder CTOs who can outvote capital deployment.
