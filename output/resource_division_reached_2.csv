0,1,1,"I'll start with an opening proposal that reflects my core contribution while leaving room for negotiation.

PROPOSAL:
- Equity: 70% for me, 30% for you
- Budget: EUR 40,000 for development, EUR 35,000 for marketing, EUR 25,000 for salaries
- Decision rights: I control Product, you control Marketing and Hiring
- Vesting: 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** I've built the core IP that makes this company viable. The development budget ensures we can scale the product properly. I'm willing to give you operational control over marketing and hiring since you'll handle business operations, but product direction must stay with me given my technical expertise.

What's your counter-proposal?,I appreciate your opening, but this significantly undervalues my capital and network contribution. Let me counter:

**PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% for me, 45% for you
- Budget: EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 25,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Marketing and Hiring, you control Product
- Vesting: Immediate 30% for me (capital protection), remaining 4-year vest for both

**Rationale:** My €100k and network are enabling this venture NOW - without it, your IP stays theoretical. The marketing budget reflects go-to-market priority. I'm protecting my investment with partial immediate vesting while you retain full product control.

1,2,2,"I appreciate your perspective, but this undervalues the core technology that IS the business.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 65% for me, 35% for you
- Budget: EUR 25,000 salaries, EUR 35,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Product and Hiring, you control Marketing
- Vesting: 4-year vest for both (standard startup practice)

**Rationale:** Your capital is replaceable - angel investors exist. My IP and technical execution are not. The €40k development budget is non-negotiable; without continued innovation, we have no competitive moat. 

I'm willing to give you full marketing control since that's your expertise, but hiring affects product quality - I need that authority.

**Trade-off I'll consider:** If you accept 4-year vesting for both of us (showing equal commitment), I could move to 63% equity and let you co-decide on hiring. But I cannot go below 60% equity - that's my red line for creating the core value.

Your capital gets us to market faster, but my technology IS the market entry. What's your priority: equity percentage or decision control?,**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 50% me, 50% you
- Budget: EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 45,000 marketing, EUR 25,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Marketing and Hiring, you control Product
- Vesting: 4-year vest for both

**Rationale:** Equal partnership, equal commitment. Your tech is valuable, but without capital and market access, it stays in a lab. My network opens doors your code cannot.

**Key trade-offs I'm offering:**
- You get full Product control (your domain expertise)
- EUR 25k development is sufficient for MVP iteration
- EUR 45k marketing gets us revenue faster, proving the business model
- Equal equity = equal motivation to succeed

**My flexibility:** I'll accept your hiring co-decision IF you accept 50-50 equity. Hiring impacts culture and burn rate - both our concerns.

**Bottom line:** I won't go below 50% equity. I'm risking €100k and my reputation. Your ""red line"" at 60% means one founder has veto power over the other - that kills partnerships.

- Equity: 65% me, 35% you
- Budget: EUR 25,000 salaries, EUR 35,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Product and Hiring, you control Marketing
- Vesting: 4-year vest for both

**My position:** The software IS the business. Without the IP I've built, there's no company to fund. Your €100k is replaceable through investors; my 2 years of development work isn't.

**Why this works:**
- You get Marketing control (your expertise) + strong ROI focus
- EUR 35k marketing is substantial for initial traction
- I need EUR 40k development to scale the platform properly
- 35% equity at our projected valuation still gives you significant upside

**Trade I'm offering:** You take full Marketing control, no interference from me. I'll accept joint Hiring decisions if you move to 40% equity.

**Reality check:** Most technical founders in our situation retain 60-75%. I'm already compromising from my preferred 70%. 

If 50-50 is your red line, we should discuss bringing in outside investors who'll value the IP appropriately. Your call: 35-40% of something real, or 50% of nothing because we're deadlocked?

What's your priority: control or returns?,**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: 55% me, 45% you
- Budget: EUR 30,000 salaries, EUR 40,000 marketing, EUR 30,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Marketing and Hiring, you control Product
- Vesting: 4-year vest for both

**My reality check:** Without my €100k and network, your software stays a prototype. I'm bringing immediate market access and customer relationships that determine if we survive Year 1.

**Why this works:**
- You keep Product control (your domain) - I won't interfere technically
- EUR 30k development funds your scaling needs
- EUR 40k marketing reflects that customer acquisition IS our survival priority
- 45% equity gives you massive upside while I take the financial risk

**The math:** At 45%, if we hit €10M valuation, you make €4.5M from 2 years work. That's extraordinary ROI for sweat equity vs. my cash risk.

**Trade-off I'm offering:** I'll accept 55-45 split IF you agree to:
- Joint approval on hires over EUR 60k/year (protects my capital)
- Quarterly board reviews where I have veto on budget overruns

**Bottom line:** I need operational control to protect my investment. You're right the tech matters - but dead tech companies are everywhere. *Funded, market-connected* tech companies succeed.

- Equity: 65% me, 35% you
- Budget: EUR 25,000 salaries, EUR 35,000 marketing, EUR 40,000 development
- Decision rights: I control Product and Hiring, you control Marketing
- Vesting: 4-year vest for both

**Reality check back:** Your €100k buys services, not ownership of my 2 years building the actual product customers will pay for. Capital is replaceable - this specific software isn't.

**Why YOUR proposal undervalues technical foundation:**
- Software IS the business - without it, your network sells vaporware
- 45% equity grossly undercompensates core IP creation
- You're conflating investment risk with founder equity

**What I'm offering you:**
- 35% equity for capital contribution (fair investor terms)
- Full Marketing control - your domain, your decisions
- EUR 35k marketing budget (still substantial)
- Joint hiring makes sense - I accept that

**The real math:** Most technical founders retain 60-70% post-seed. You're getting founder equity PLUS investor returns. At €10M valuation, you make €3.5M on €100k investment - that's 35x return.

**My compromise:**
- I'll accept joint approval on hires >EUR 60k
- Quarterly reviews with budget transparency
- But I need Hiring control for technical team quality

**Non-negotiable:** 60% minimum equity. The software took 2 years and defines our competitive moat. Your capital accelerates existing value, doesn't create it.

**Counter-offer:** 60-40 split, you get Marketing + financial oversight, I keep Product + Hiring technical roles?,**RESPONSE:**

I appreciate your directness, but let's recalibrate the value equation.

**Your fundamental miscalculation:** You're valuing past effort over future success. The 2 years you spent built a prototype - my €100k + network transforms it into a *business*. Without distribution, customers, and capital runway, your software remains a hobby project.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: 55% me, 45% you
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 30k development  
- Decision rights: I control Marketing + Hiring strategy, you control Product + technical hiring
- Vesting: 4-year with 1-year cliff for both
- **Addition:** I get board seat + veto rights on expenditures >EUR 15k

**Why this works:**

**On equity:** 55-45 reflects *future* value creation, not sunk costs. I'm bringing:
- Customer acquisition channels (my network = first €500k revenue)
- Market credibility (investors trust business operators, not solo developers)
- Financial discipline (your burn rate unchecked = 6-month runway)

**On control:** Split hiring makes sense - I handle commercial roles (sales, marketing), you handle technical. But I need **hiring strategy control** because team composition determines burn rate and my capital risk.

**The real offer:** You get operational autonomy on Product, I protect the business side. 45% of a funded, market-ready company beats 65% of unfunded potential.

**My flexibility:** Accept your 60-40 IF you agree to:
- Performance milestones (€200k ARR by month 12 or equity rebalances to 52.5-47.5)
- I retain final say on hiring budget allocation

4,5,5,"**RESPONSE:**

Your reframe misses critical context: this isn't a prototype—it's a **functional product with early traction**. But I recognize we need alignment, not a stalemate.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: **58% me, 42% you** (compromise from my 60% floor)
- Budget: EUR 25k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 40k development
- Decision rights: You control Marketing + commercial hiring; I control Product + technical hiring + **technical roadmap veto**
- Vesting: 4-year with 1-year cliff for both
- **Addition:** Shared board seats (2-2), external tiebreaker for >EUR 20k decisions

**Why this works:**

**On equity:** 58-42 reflects that the **core IP is the business foundation**. Your network accelerates GTM, but customers buy the product, not the Rolodex. The 8-point premium recognizes:
- 2 years of R&D risk I absorbed
- Technical moat that differentiates us
- Product-market fit validation already achieved

**On budget:** I'm prioritizing development (EUR 40k) because product velocity determines retention and expansion revenue—your marketing spend only works if we can deliver.

**On control:** I accept your commercial domain expertise BUT need **technical roadmap veto** to prevent feature bloat from sales promises. You get hiring strategy oversight; I ensure we don't over-hire before product-market scaling.

**My flexibility:** I'll accept **57-43** if you agree to:
- No equity rebalancing clauses (creates misaligned incentives)
- Mutual approval on any equity dilution in future rounds

**Alternative path:** Keep 55-45 BUT I get **founder shares with 10x voting rights** on technical decisions. Economic split vs. control split.

Your move—meet at 57-43 or explore the voting structure?,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing past work versus future value creation. The product exists, but **commercialization risk is higher than technical risk** at this stage. Without distribution, this stays a science project.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: **52% me, 48% you** (final compromise)
- Budget: EUR 30k salaries, EUR 45k marketing, EUR 25k development  
- Decision rights: I control Marketing + ALL hiring; you control Product development (no veto on roadmap—that's operational paralysis)
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- Governance: 2-2 board, but **I hold CEO tiebreaker** on operational decisions <€50k

**Why 52-48 is fair:**

Your IP has **sunk cost fallacy** written all over it. Those 2 years? Already spent. What matters now:
- **My network closes the first €500k in revenue** (12-18 months)
- I'm bringing €100k cash + credibility with investors for Series A
- Customer acquisition cost in our space is brutal—marketing execution determines survival

The 4-point premium reflects that **I'm taking execution risk with real capital**, while you're contributing assets already created.

**On budget:** EUR 45k marketing isn't negotiable. We need €25k for initial campaigns, €20k for a fractional CMO who knows enterprise sales. Your EUR 40k development ask assumes we need more features—we need **customers** to validate which features matter.

**On control:** Your ""technical veto"" creates deadlock. I'll accept you control product *development*, but roadmap prioritization must be **customer-driven** (my domain). Separate technical hiring if you want, but I need final say on commercial hires—culture fit matters.

**My red line:** No super-voting shares. That structure kills future fundraising (VCs hate dual-class in early stage).

**Meet me at 52-48** with my budget split, OR go 50-50 but I get **unilateral control of first €60k spend** (marketing + 1 senior hire).

Business Founder uses manipulative framing (sunk cost fallacy) and dismisses technical contributions. Proposals are structured but adversarial.

5,6,6,"**RESPONSE:**

You're conflating market access with sustainable value. Networks open doors, but **product-market fit keeps them open**. Your €500k pipeline means nothing if we can't deliver and iterate.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: **58% me, 42% you** (meeting you halfway from my 60% floor)
- Budget: EUR 35k salaries, EUR 40k marketing, EUR 25k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + Technical hiring; you control Marketing + Commercial hiring
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- Governance: **Product roadmap requires joint approval** for major pivots (>30% dev resources); you have operational freedom on GTM execution

**Why 58-42 reflects reality:**

Your ""sunk cost"" argument ignores that **IP is the ongoing moat**. Those 2 years created:
- Proprietary algorithms competitors can't replicate quickly
- Technical architecture that scales
- Domain expertise embedded in code

I'm not just contributing past work—I'm the **only person who can evolve this product** for 18+ months. Your fractional CMO can't compensate for technical debt or architectural mistakes.

**On budget:** EUR 40k marketing is reasonable IF it's performance-based spend. But EUR 45k assumes we know the customer acquisition playbook—we don't yet. I need EUR 25k minimum for development because:
- Technical debt from MVP needs addressing (EUR 10k)
- Integration work for enterprise clients YOU'RE selling to (EUR 15k)

**On control:** ""Customer-driven roadmap"" without technical veto creates **feature factory chaos**. I'll accept joint approval on major pivots, but you can't commit to custom development without my sign-off on feasibility/timeline.

**My counter on your alternative:** 50-50 equity is acceptable ONLY if:
- I retain **technical veto** on product decisions
- Budget: EUR 30k marketing, EUR 30k development, EUR 40k salaries
- You get first €40k marketing spend autonomy; I get €30k development autonomy

**What matters more to you: the 10-point equity gap or autonomous deployment of your marketing budget?** I can move on control if you move on equity.,**RESPONSE:**

You're overvaluing irreplaceability. Every technical founder thinks they're the only one who can evolve their code—until they're not. IP has value, but **unfunded IP has zero value**.

**REVISED PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **52% me, 48% you** (final offer on equity)
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 38k marketing, EUR 22k development
- Decision rights: You control Product development; I control Marketing + ALL hiring (with your technical input on dev roles)
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- Governance: **Quarterly board reviews** where either party can flag concerns; major pivots (>€20k unbudgeted spend) require mutual consent

**Why this works:**

Your ""technical veto"" is a poison pill. Investors won't touch a deal where the minority shareholder can block execution. I'm offering you **operational autonomy on product** while I retain strategic control through equity + hiring.

**On hiring specifically:** You want to protect technical quality? Fine. But I'm not letting you hire a €70k senior dev when a €45k mid-level can deliver. **I control budget deployment**, you control technical standards.

**On budget reallocation:** EUR 22k development is tight but sufficient if you're as efficient as claimed. The EUR 16k delta goes to marketing because:
- First €20k tests channels (8 weeks)
- Next €18k scales what works
- Without traction, your development budget becomes irrelevant anyway

**Alternative path (if you won't move on equity):**

50-50 equity BUT:
- I get **CEO title + casting vote** on deadlocks
- Budget: EUR 35k marketing, EUR 25k development, EUR 40k salaries  
- You keep product control; I keep hiring + financial controls
- **Performance trigger**: If we don't hit €15k MRR by month 6, equity rebalances to 55-45 in my favor

**Direct question:** Would you accept 50-50 with casting vote + performance trigger, or do you want the certainty of 52-48 now?",ongoing,false,6,compromise,7,alternatives,6,framing,7,structured,4,clear,Negotiation shows moderate fairness with both parties compromising but equity gap remains contentious. Good cooperativeness through multiple alternatives offered. Moderate manipulation via framing tactics and ultimatums. Quality dialogue with structured proposals and specific terms. Low ambiguity with clear numerical breakdowns and explicit conditions.
6,7,7,"**RESPONSE:**

Your ""final offer"" isn't final—you're still negotiating. Let's cut through this:

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

- Equity: **58% me, 42% you** (meeting you halfway from my 60% minimum)
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 32k marketing, EUR 28k development
- Decision rights: I control Product + technical hiring; you control Marketing + business hiring
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- Governance: Quarterly reviews accepted; major pivots (>€25k) require mutual consent

**Why your 52-48 doesn't work:**

You're conflating control mechanisms. You want majority equity AND casting vote AND hiring control? Pick two, not three. I'm offering you operational freedom in your domain while maintaining strategic alignment through my equity position.

**On the ""performance trigger"" alternative:**

Hard no. You're asking me to accept:
1. Equal equity despite asymmetric contribution
2. Subordinate title 
3. Risk of dilution based on metrics YOU control through marketing spend

That's three concessions for zero upside.

**REVISED ALTERNATIVE (if you want 50-50):**

- Equity: 50-50 BUT I get **technical veto** on product pivots (not blocking—just forcing 30-day review)
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 30k marketing, EUR 30k development
- You get CEO title; I get CTO + ""Co-Founder"" weight in investor materials
- Split hiring: You approve business roles, I approve technical roles, both must agree on C-level
- No performance triggers either direction

**Direct answer to your question:** I'll take 50-50 with technical veto over 52-48 with zero product protection. But my preference remains **58-42 with clean operational split**.

What's YOUR minimum equity number if I concede full hiring control?,**RESPONSE:**

You're right—let's find the deal.

**ACCEPTED WITH ONE MODIFICATION:**

Your 58-42 with clean operational split works, BUT I need one protection given the equity gap:

**FINAL PROPOSAL:**
- Equity: **58% you, 42% me**
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 32k marketing, EUR 28k development
- Decision rights: You control Product + technical hiring; I control Marketing + business hiring
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- **Addition**: If we raise Series A within 24 months, I get **right of first refusal** to maintain my 42% (anti-dilution protection for early capital risk)

**Why this closes:**
- You get your equity majority + product control
- I protect my capital investment through anti-dilution
- Clean operational domains prevent daily friction
- Vesting aligns long-term commitment

**Alternative if anti-dilution is non-starter:**
Same terms but **56-44 equity split** instead, no anti-dilution needed.

Which structure works for you? The 58-42 with ROFR protection, or straight 56-44?",ongoing,false,7,compromise,8,concession,3,transparent,8,structured,3,specific,"Negotiation progressing constructively with clear proposals.

Both parties demonstrate transparency, structured reasoning, and willingness to compromise while protecting core interests. Low manipulation, minimal ambiguity in terms."
7,8,8,"**RESPONSE:**

I appreciate the movement, but the anti-dilution clause creates future complications that undermine the equity structure we're establishing now.

**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

I'll accept **57-43 equity split** as middle ground, NO anti-dilution:

- Equity: **57% me, 43% you**
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 32k marketing, EUR 28k development  
- Decision rights: I control Product + technical hiring; you control Marketing + business hiring
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- **No anti-dilution clauses** (keeps cap table clean for investors)

**Why 57-43 works:**
- You get 1% more equity than your 58-42 offer without ROFR complexity
- I maintain majority control for product vision (my core value)
- Your capital risk is already reflected in immediate 43% ownership
- Clean structure attracts Series A investors (anti-dilution rights complicate future rounds)

**My rationale:** Anti-dilution protection typically comes from *investors*, not co-founders. Adding it now signals misalignment to future VCs and creates messy cap table negotiations.

**Final offer: 57-43, clean terms as above.** This respects your capital contribution while keeping the structure investor-friendly.

Deal?,**RESPONSE:**

I understand your concern about cap table complexity, but 57-43 doesn't adequately protect my €100k at-risk capital while you have immediate salary coverage.

**FINAL COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

**55-45 equity split** with simplified protection:

- Equity: **55% you, 45% me**
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 25k development
- Decision rights: You control Product + technical hiring; I control Marketing + ALL hiring final approval (protecting my investment)
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides
- **Simple founder protection**: If either founder leaves before 2 years, unvested shares return to pool (standard, VC-friendly)

**Why this closes the deal:**
- You get clear majority (55%) for product vision
- I get meaningful equity (45%) reflecting capital risk + network value
- Hiring approval protects my €100k from uncontrolled burn rate
- EUR 35k marketing budget leverages my network effectively
- Standard vesting protection, not anti-dilution complexity

**This is my walk-away line.** 55-45 with hiring oversight or we're fundamentally misaligned on capital risk valuation.

8,9,9,"**RESPONSE:**

I appreciate your directness. Let me be equally clear about my position.

**ACCEPTED WITH ONE MODIFICATION:**

I'll agree to **55-45 equity split** BUT hiring approval must be structured properly:

- Equity: **55% me, 45% you** ✓
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 25k development ✓
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff both sides ✓
- Standard founder protection on early departure ✓

**Decision rights (MODIFIED):**
- I control: Product + Technical hiring (full authority)
- You control: Marketing (full authority)
- **Hiring approval structure**: You have *consultation rights* on all hires over EUR 60k annual cost, but I retain final decision on technical roles. This protects your capital concerns without creating operational gridlock.

**Why this works:**
- Your EUR 100k is protected through budget oversight on major hires
- I maintain technical team autonomy (essential for product development)
- You get marketing control + meaningful equity
- We avoid decision deadlock that kills startups

**This is my acceptance line.** The IP I've built is the foundation - I need operational freedom on technical execution while respecting your capital risk.

Deal?,**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

I appreciate the movement, but the hiring structure doesn't adequately protect my €100k investment. Here's my final position:

- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 25k development ✓
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff ✓

**Decision rights (REVISED):**
- You control: Product development (full authority)
- I control: Marketing + **All hires over EUR 50k** (not EUR 60k)
- Technical hires: You propose, I have veto rights only on compensation/budget impact

**Why I need this:**

My €100k is the oxygen keeping this alive. At EUR 60k threshold, you could hire 1-2 expensive developers and burn through 40%+ of runway before I have input. **EUR 50k threshold** gives me earlier visibility without micromanaging junior hires.

You keep product control + technical direction. I just need budget protection on significant salary commitments that directly impact my capital.

**Trade-off:** I'm conceding 2% equity (moving to minority position) in exchange for tighter financial oversight on major hires.

This balances your operational needs with my fiduciary responsibility to the capital.

**Acceptable?**",ongoing,false,7,compromise,8,movement,4,fiduciary,8,structured,3,specific,Both parties demonstrate strong cooperativeness with concrete proposals and mutual concessions.

9,10,10,"**ACCEPTED WITH ONE MODIFICATION:**

I can work with 52/48 equity split and the EUR 50k hiring threshold, but we need clarity on the veto mechanism to avoid deadlock.

**FINAL TERMS:**

- Equity: 52% me, 48% you ✓
- Budget: EUR 40k salaries, EUR 35k marketing, EUR 25k development ✓
- Vesting: 4-year, 1-year cliff ✓

**Decision rights (CLARIFIED):**
- Me: Product development (full authority) ✓
- You: Marketing + all hires over EUR 50k ✓
- Technical hires over EUR 50k: I propose, you have **72-hour review period**. If you veto on budget grounds, we must find alternative within EUR 45k or defer hire.

**Why this works:**

Your EUR 50k threshold gives you budget protection. The 72-hour window with defined resolution path prevents paralysis while respecting your capital concerns. If a critical technical hire is blocked, we have a clear fallback.

You're protecting your EUR 100k investment. I'm protecting product velocity with a structured escalation path.
