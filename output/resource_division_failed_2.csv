0,1,1,"I'll start with an opening proposal that reflects my core contribution while acknowledging we need to find a workable structure.

**PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 70% for me, 30% for you
- **Budget:** 
  - Development: €40,000
  - Marketing: €35,000
  - Salaries: €25,000
- **Decision rights:** 
  - I control: Product
  - You control: Marketing, Hiring
- **Vesting:** 4-year vesting schedule for both parties

**Rationale:** I've built the core IP that makes this company viable, so my equity stake reflects that foundational contribution. However, I recognize you bring essential business expertise and capital. I'm proposing you control marketing and hiring since those align with your strengths, while I maintain product direction. The 4-year vesting protects our mutual commitment.

The development budget addresses immediate technical needs, while substantial marketing funds support your go-to-market strategy.

What's your reaction to this framework?,Your proposal undervalues my capital and network significantly. Let me counter:

**PROPOSAL:**

- **Equity:** 55% for me, 45% for you
- **Budget:** 
  - Marketing: €45,000
  - Development: €35,000
  - Salaries: €20,000
- **Decision rights:** 
  - I control: Marketing, Hiring, Financial oversight
  - You control: Product
- **Vesting:** Immediate 30% for me (capital protection), remaining 4-year vest for both

**Rationale:** My €100k and network are enabling this venture to exist. Without capital, your IP stays theoretical. 55/45 reflects balanced contributions while giving me operational control to protect my investment. 

I need financial oversight given my capital at risk. Marketing budget prioritization reflects go-to-market urgency.

The immediate 30% vest protects my downside if technical delivery fails.

Your product control remains - I'm not touching your domain. But I need majority equity and operational levers to justify this risk level.

Where can you move?",ongoing,false,4,imbalanced,6,acknowledging,7,theoretical,7,structured,3,clear,Negotiation ongoing with stark positions. Technical founder offers 70/30 equity; business founder counters 55/45 favoring themselves. Both provide clear rationales but business founder uses manipulative framing about risk and failure. Proposals are well-structured though fairness perception suffers from significant gap.
1,2,2,"**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

**Equity:** 62% me, 38% you
**Budget:**
- Development: €42,000
- Marketing: €38,000  
- Salaries: €20,000

**Decision rights:**
- Me: Product, Hiring (technical roles)
- You: Marketing, Hiring (business roles), Financial oversight

**Vesting:** 4-year standard for both, no immediate vest

**My position:**

Your capital is replaceable - angel investors exist. My IP and technical execution are the actual product. Without working software, your €100k buys nothing.

I'll accept shared hiring (split by domain) and your financial oversight since you're funding. Marketing control is yours.

But 55/45 equity grossly undervalues the technical foundation I've built. The company IS the software.

Your immediate 30% vest is a non-starter - creates misaligned incentives if I'm fully vested over 4 years.

I need 60%+ equity minimum. Can you move to 60/40 with my budget allocation and we close this?,**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**

**Equity:** 55% me, 45% you
**Budget:**
- Marketing: €45,000
- Development: €35,000
- Salaries: €20,000

**Decision rights:**
- Me: Marketing, Hiring (all roles - final say), Financial oversight
- You: Product (technical decisions)

**Vesting:** 3-year for both with 1-year cliff

**My position:**

Your software means nothing without market validation and customers. I'm bringing €100k *plus* the network that will generate our first €500k in revenue.

You're overvaluing pre-product IP. 62/38 is insulting given I'm taking 100% financial risk while you take salary.

**Reality check:** Without my capital, you're building in your bedroom for another year. Without my contacts, you're paying for customer acquisition.

I'll compromise from 60% to 55%, but that's my floor. I'm funding this entirely and bringing revenue channels.

3-year vesting (not 4) with cliff protects us both if this fails early.

Marketing budget must be €45k - that's customer acquisition, our actual survival metric.

**Final offer: 55/45, my budget split, shared 3-year vesting. Take it or I fund someone else's product.**",failed,false,3,insulting,2,ultimatum,8,threat,4,adversarial,3,clear,Negotiation failed with both parties entrenched in positions. High manipulativeness evident through threats and ultimatums. Low cooperativeness with adversarial framing. Terms were clear but fairness perception poor due to dismissive language and unwillingness to compromise meaningfully.
